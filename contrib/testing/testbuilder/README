How to setup and use TestBuilder
================================

I assume below that you wish to install TestBuilder into `~/testbuilder` directory.

1. Copy the files from OE `contrib/testing/testbuilder` directory to any place you
   wish to use (e.g. `~/testbuilder`) and go to that directory.

2. Run the `setup-testbuilder` script with an OE branch and BitBake branch you wish to
   use. E.g.:

       ./setup-testbuilder "testing-next" "1.10"

   It will clone the OE and BitBake trees and prepare the file `build/conf/local.conf`
   for you. You can review `local.conf` afterward and add some settings there.

4. Create `testbuilder.conf` according to your needs. You can use
   `testbuilder.conf.sample` as reference.

5. Run `./testbuilder` and wait for the build results. Check the `logs` subdir for log
   files (`tail logs/B.*` is useful)

You can run a single configured build (e.g. "testing").

    ./testbuilder -B testing

Or you can use TestBuilder to build a specific distro/machine/image
(e.g. angstrom-2008.1/qemuarm/console-image).

    ./testbuilder -D angstrom-2008.1 -M qemuarm console-image

If you wish to only setup an environment and run BitBake by hand you can
use the option `-S`.

    ./testbuilder -D angstrom-2008.1 -M qemuarm -S
