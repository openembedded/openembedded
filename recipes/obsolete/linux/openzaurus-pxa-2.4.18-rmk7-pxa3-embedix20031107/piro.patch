+		  Proper Locking Under a Preemptible Kernel:
+		       Keeping Kernel Code Preempt-Safe
+			  Robert Love <rml@tech9.net>
+			   Last Updated: 22 Jan 2002
+
+
+INTRODUCTION
+
+
+A preemptible kernel creates new locking issues.  The issues are the same as
+those under SMP: concurrency and reentrancy.  Thankfully, the Linux preemptible
+kernel model leverages existing SMP locking mechanisms.  Thus, the kernel
+requires explicit additional locking for very few additional situations.
+
+This document is for all kernel hackers.  Developing code in the kernel
+requires protecting these situations.
+ 
+
+RULE #1: Per-CPU data structures need explicit protection
+
+
+Two similar problems arise. An example code snippet:
+
+	struct this_needs_locking tux[NR_CPUS];
+	tux[smp_processor_id()] = some_value;
+	/* task is preempted here... */
+	something = tux[smp_processor_id()];
+
+First, since the data is per-CPU, it may not have explicit SMP locking, but
+require it otherwise.  Second, when a preempted task is finally rescheduled,
+the previous value of smp_processor_id may not equal the current.  You must
+protect these situations by disabling preemption around them.
+
+
+RULE #2: CPU state must be protected.
+
+
+Under preemption, the state of the CPU must be protected.  This is arch-
+dependent, but includes CPU structures and state not preserved over a context
+switch.  For example, on x86, entering and exiting FPU mode is now a critical
+section that must occur while preemption is disabled.  Think what would happen
+if the kernel is executing a floating-point instruction and is then preempted.
+Remember, the kernel does not save FPU state except for user tasks.  Therefore,
+upon preemption, the FPU registers will be sold to the lowest bidder.  Thus,
+preemption must be disabled around such regions.
+
+Note, some FPU functions are already explicitly preempt safe.  For example,
+kernel_fpu_begin and kernel_fpu_end will disable and enable preemption.
+However, math_state_restore must be called with preemption disabled.
+
+
+RULE #3: Lock acquire and release must be performed by same task
+
+
+A lock acquired in one task must be released by the same task.  This
+means you can't do oddball things like acquire a lock and go off to
+play while another task releases it.  If you want to do something
+like this, acquire and release the task in the same code path and
+have the caller wait on an event by the other task.
+
+
+SOLUTION
+
+
+Data protection under preemption is achieved by disabling preemption for the
+duration of the critical region.
+
+preempt_enable()		decrement the preempt counter
+preempt_disable()		increment the preempt counter
+preempt_enable_no_resched()	decrement, but do not immediately preempt
+preempt_get_count()		return the preempt counter
+
+The functions are nestable.  In other words, you can call preempt_disable
+n-times in a code path, and preemption will not be reenabled until the n-th
+call to preempt_enable.  The preempt statements define to nothing if
+preemption is not enabled.
+
+Note that you do not need to explicitly prevent preemption if you are holding
+any locks or interrupts are disabled, since preemption is implicitly disabled
+in those cases.
+
+Example:
+
+	cpucache_t *cc; /* this is per-CPU */
+	preempt_disable();
+	cc = cc_data(searchp);
+	if (cc && cc->avail) {
+		__free_block(searchp, cc_entry(cc), cc->avail);
+		cc->avail = 0;
+	}
+	preempt_enable();
+	return 0;
+
+Notice how the preemption statements must encompass every reference of the
+critical variables.  Another example:
+
+	int buf[NR_CPUS];
+	set_cpu_val(buf);
+	if (buf[smp_processor_id()] == -1) printf(KERN_INFO "wee!\n");
+	spin_lock(&buf_lock);
+	/* ... */
+
+This code is not preempt-safe, but see how easily we can fix it by simply
+moving the spin_lock up two lines.

+ * Obligatory macros:

+ *	HASH_LONG_LOG2 *has to* be defined along
+ * HASH_CTX
+ *	context structure that at least contains following

+ *			HASH_LONG	data[HASH_LBLOCK];

+ * HASH_UPDATE
+ *	name of "Update" function, implemented here.
+ * HASH_TRANSFORM
+ *	name of "Transform" function, implemented here.
+ * HASH_FINAL
+ *	name of "Final" function, implemented here.
+ * HASH_BLOCK_HOST_ORDER
+ *	name of "block" function treating *aligned* input message
+ *	in host byte order, implemented externally.
+ * HASH_BLOCK_DATA_ORDER
+ *	name of "block" function treating *unaligned* input message
+ *	in original (data) byte order, implemented externally (it
+ *	actually is optional if data and host are of the same
+ *	"endianess").
+ * HASH_MAKE_STRING
+ *	macro convering context variables to an ASCII hash string.
+ *
+ * Optional macros:
+ *
+ * B_ENDIAN or L_ENDIAN
+ *	defines host byte-order.
+ * HASH_LONG_LOG2
+ *	defaults to 2 if not states otherwise.
+ * HASH_LBLOCK

+	 * and, or and finally 64-bit store. Peaking data and operating
+	 * at natural word size made it possible to reduce amount of
+	 * instructions as well as to perform early read-ahead without
+	 * suffering from RAW (read-after-write) hazard. This resulted
+	 * in ~40%(**) performance improvement on 21064 box with gcc.
+	 * But it's not only Alpha users who win here:-) Thanks to the
+	 * early-n-wide read-ahead this implementation also exhibits
+	 * >40% speed-up on SPARC and 20-30% on 64-bit MIPS (depending
+	 * on sizeof(RC4_INT)).
+	 *
+	 * (*)	"this" means code which recognizes the case when input
+	 *	and output pointers appear to be aligned at natural CPU
+	 *	word boundary
+	 * (**)	i.e. according to 'apps/openssl speed rc4' benchmark,
+	 *	crypto/rc4/rc4speed.c exhibits almost 70% speed-up...
+	 *
+	 * Cavets.
+	 *
+	 * - RC4_CHUNK="unsigned long long" should be a #1 choice for
+	 *   UltraSPARC. Unfortunately gcc generates very slow code
+	 *   (2.5-3 times slower than one generated by Sun's WorkShop
+	 *   C) and therefore gcc (at least 2.95 and earlier) should
+	 *   always be told that RC4_CHUNK="unsigned long".

+/* The macros below are to be used for shared library (.so, .dll, ...)
+ * versioning.  That kind of versioning works a bit differently between
+ * operating systems.  The most usual scheme is to set a major and a minor
+ * number, and have the runtime loader check that the major number is equal
+ * to what it was at application link time, while the minor number has to
+ * be greater or equal to what it was at application link time.  With this
+ * scheme, the version number is usually part of the file name, like this:
+ *
+ *	libcrypto.so.0.9
+ *
+ * Some unixen also make a softlink with the major verson number only:
+ *
+ *	libcrypto.so.0
+ *
+ * On True64 it works a little bit differently.  There, the shared library
+ * version is stored in the file, and is actually a series of versions,
+ * separated by colons.  The rightmost version present in the library when
+ * linking an application is stored in the application to be matched at
+ * run time.  When the application is run, a check is done to see if the
+ * library version stored in the application matches any of the versions
+ * in the version string of the library itself.
+ * This version string can be constructed in any way, depending on what
+ * kind of matching is desired.  However, to implement the same scheme as
+ * the one used in the other unixen, all compatible versions, from lowest
+ * to highest, should be part of the string.  Consecutive builds would
+ * give the following versions strings:
+ *
+ *	3.0
+ *	3.0:3.1
+ *	3.0:3.1:3.2
+ *	4.0
+ *	4.0:4.1
+ *
+ * Notice how version 4 is completely incompatible with version, and
+ * therefore give the breach you can see.
+ *
+ * There may be other schemes as well that I haven't yet discovered.
+ *
+ * So, here's the way it works here: first of all, the library version
+ * number doesn't need at all to match the overall OpenSSL version.
+ * However, it's nice and more understandable if it actually does.
+ * The current library version is stored in the macro SHLIB_VERSION_NUMBER,
+ * which is just a piece of text in the format "M.m.e" (Major, minor, edit).
+ * For the sake of True64 and any other OS that behaves in similar ways,
+ * we need to keep a history of version numbers, which is done in the
+ * macro SHLIB_VERSION_HISTORY.  The numbers are separated by colons and
+ * should only keep the versions that are binary compatible with the current.
