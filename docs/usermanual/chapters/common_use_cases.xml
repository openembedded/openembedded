        <title>building from unstable source code</title>
        <para>Building against the latest, bleeding-edge source has some intricacies of its own.
        For one, it is desirable to pin down a 1 code revision that is known to build to

        how to do that properly.

        </para>
        <para>
        If you really absolutely have to follow the latest commits, you can do that by adding
        'SRCREV_pn-linux-davinci ?= ${AUTOREV}' to your local.conf, for example.  In this case,
        you'd build against the most recent and unstable source for the pn-linux-davinci package.

      <title>Setting up OpenEmbedded</title>

      <para>OpenEmbedded will be setup here. We assume that your machine and
      distribution is not part of OpenEmbedded and they will be created ad-hoc
      in the <emphasis>local.conf</emphasis> file. You will need to have
      <application>BitBake</application> and a current OpenEmbedded version
      available.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Sourceable script</title>

        <para>To ease the usage of OpenEmbedded we start by creating a
        source-able script. This is actually a small variation from the
        already seen script. We will name it <emphasis>build_source</emphasis>

        <para>Create a distribution ad-hoc as well. We tell OpenEmbedded that
        we build for linux and glibc using soft float as fpu. If your

    <section>
      <title>Useful hints</title>

      <para>If you have more prebuilt libraries you need to add additional
      <command>ASSUME_PROVIDED</command> lines to your
      <emphasis>local.conf</emphasis>. Using <command>bitbake -vvv

      <para>OpenEmbedded tries to automatically add run-time dependencies
      (RDEPENDS) to generated packages. It is inspecting binaries and
      libraries and uses the <emphasis><link linkend="shlibs">shlibs</link>
      </emphasis> system to do add dependencies for the linked libraries,
      however in this case it was not able to find packages providing these
      libraries as they were prebuilt.
      </para>

      <para>One way to resolve this problem is to provide an explicit mapping
      using the ASSUME_SHLIBS variable in a config file <filename>local.conf</filename>.
      For example, for the libraries above (partial):
      <screen>
ASSUME_SHLIBS = "libqtopia2.so.2:qtopia2_2.4 libc.so.6:libc"
</screen>
      The format is shlib_file_name:package[_version]. If a version is specified it will be
      used as the minimal (>=) version for the dependency.</para>

            <para>The SDK should contain a build of Qt Embedded, but also

            down extra dependencies.

            files and libraries will be installed.
            </para>

            <para>To build the SDK, setup OpenEmbedded in the usual way by picking
            a <emphasis>DISTRO</emphasis> and <emphasis>MACHINE</emphasis>. Issue
            the below command and after the operation finished you should find

            <title>Using the Qt Embedded SDK</title>

            <para>In this example we are assuming that the target hardware
            is an armv5t system and the SDK targets the Angstrom Distribution. You
            should start by downloading the SDK and untar it to the root folder
            (<filename>/</filename>). Once this operation is finished you will
            find a new directory <filename>/usr/local/angstrom/arm/</filename> and
            it contains the <filename>environment-setup</filename> to setup the
            <emphasis>QMAKESPEC</emphasis> and various other paths.
            </para>

<screen>
Untar the SDK once
$ <command>tar</command> -C / -xjf angstrom-armv5te-linux-gnueabi-toolchain-qte.tar.bz2

Before using it source the environment
$ <command>.</command> /usr/local/angstrom/arm/environment-setup

Use qmake2 to build software for the target
$ <command>qmake2</command>

            <para>Creating and building a simple example. We will create a simple
            Qt Embedded application and use <command>qmake2</command> and
            <command>make</command> to cross compile.
