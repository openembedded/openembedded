    <para>The required version of <application>BitBake</application> is
    changing rapidly. At the time of writing (end 2007)
    <application>BitBake</application> 1.8.latest was required.</para>

    <para>A safe method is to get the <application>BitBake</application> from
    a stable Subversion branch (those with an even minor number). <screen>
<command>svn</command> co http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/bitbake/branches/bitbake-1.8
...
A   bitbake-1.8/classes/base.bbclass
U   bitbake-1.8
At revision 827.
            </screen> <application>BitBake</application> is checked out now;
    this completes the first and most critical dependency of OpenEmbedded.
    Issuing <command>svn</command> <command>up</command> in the
    <emphasis>bitbake-1.8</emphasis> directory will update
    <application>BitBake</application> to the latest stable version, but
    generally it is a good idea to stick with a specific known working version
    of <application>BitBake</application> until OpenEmbedded asks you to
    upgrade.</para>

    <para>The OpenEmbedded metadata has a high rate of development, so it's a
    good idea to stay up to date. You'll need monotone 0.28 to get the
    metadata and stay up to date. Monotone is available in most distributions
    and has binaries at <ulink url="http://venge.net/monotone/">Monotone
    homepage</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Next step is getting snapshot of database. <screen>
wget http://openembedded.org/snapshots/OE.mtn.bz2 http://openembedded.org/snapshots/OE.mtn.bz2.md5
</screen> Or if you have monotone 0.30 or later: <screen>
wget http://www.openembedded.org/snapshots/OE-this-is-for-mtn-0.30.mtn.bz2 
wget http://www.openembedded.org/snapshots/OE-this-is-for-mtn-0.30.mtn.bz2.md5
</screen> Then verify integrity of snapshot by checking md5sum. <screen>
md5sum -c OE.mtn.bz2.md5sum
</screen> Then unpack database. <screen>
bunzip OE.mtn.bz2
</screen> Finally checkout the development branch. <screen>
mtn --db=OE.mtn co -b org.openembedded.dev
