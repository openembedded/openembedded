    <para>Creating a new distribution is not complicated, however we urge you
    to try existing distributions first, because it's also very easy to do

        <title>building from unstable source code</title>
        <para>Building against the latest, bleeding-edge source has some intricacies of its own.
        For one, it is desirable to pin down a souce code revision that is known to build to 
        prevent random breakage in OE at the most inopportune time for all OE users.  Here is
        how to do that properly.
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>for svn: add 'PV = "1.1+svnr${SRCREV}"' to your bb file.</listitem>
            <listitem>for cvs: add 'PV = "1.1+cvs${SRCREV}"' to your bb file.</listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        Accompany either with an entry to conf/sane-srcrevs.inc for a revision that you know
        builds successfully.
        </para>
        <para>
        If you really absolutely have to follow the latest commits, you can do that by adding
        'SRCREV_pn-linux-davinci ?= ${AUTOREV}' to your local.conf, for example.  In this case,
        you'd build against the most recent and unstable source for the pn-linux-davinci package.

  <section id="commonuse_prebuilt_toolchain">
    <title>Using a prebuilt toolchain to create your packages</title>

    <para>It might be necessary to integrate a prebuilt toolchain and other
    libraries but still be use OpenEmbedded to build packages. One of many
    approaches is shown and discussed here.</para>

    <section>
      <title>The toolchain</title>

      <para>We assume the toolchain provides a C and C++ compiler, an
      assembler and other tools to build packages. The list below shows a gcc
      3.4.4 toolchain for ARM architectures using glibc. We assume that the
      toolchain is in your <command>PATH</command>.</para>

arm-linux-objdump
</screen>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>The prebuilt libraries</title>

      <para>We need the header files and the libraries itself. The following
      directory layout is assume. <command>PRE_BUILT</command> has two
      subdirectories one is called <emphasis>include</emphasis> and holds the
      header files and the other directory is called <emphasis>lib</emphasis>
      and holds the shared and static libraries. Additionally a Qt2 directory
      is present having a <emphasis>include</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>lib</emphasis> sub-directory.</para>

      <screen>
<command>ls</command> $PRE_BUILT
include
lib
qt2
</screen>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Setting up OpenEmbedded</title>

      <para>OpenEmbedded will be setup here. We assume that your machine and
      distribution is not part of OpenEmbedded and they will be created ad-hoc
      in the <emphasis>local.conf</emphasis> file. You will need to have
      <application>BitBake</application> and a current OpenEmbedded version
      available.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Sourcable script</title>

        <para>To ease the usage of OpenEmbedded we start by creating a
        source-able script. This is actually a small variation from the
        already seen script. We will name it <emphasis>build_source</emphasis>
        and you will need to source it.</para>

        <screen>
BITBAKE_PATH=/where/is/bitbake/bin
TOOLCHAIN=/where/is/toolchain/bin
HOST_TOOLS=/where/is/hosttools/bin
export PRE_BUILT=/where/is/pre-built

export PATH=$BITBAKE_PATH:$TOOLCHAIN:$HOST_TOOLS:$PATH
export OEDIR=$PWD
export LOCALDIR=$PWD/secret-isv
                    </screen>

        <para>Use <command>source build_source</command> to source the script,
        use <command>env</command> to check that the variable where
        exported.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Creating the local.conf</title>

        <para>We will configure OpenEmbedded now, it is very similar to what
        we have done above.</para>

        <screen>

BBFILE_PRIORITY_upstream = "5"
BBFILE_PRIORITY_local = "10"
BBMASK = ""
                    </screen>

        <para>${OEDIR}/openembedded will be a upstream release of
        OpenEmbedded. Above we have assumed it is in the current working
        directory. Additionally we have a ${LOCALDIR}, we combine these two
        directories as a special <link linkend="collections">BitBake
        Collection</link>.</para>

        <screen>
#
# machine stuff
#
MACHINE = "secret-killer"
PACKAGE_EXTRA_ARCHS = "armv4 armv4t armv5te iwmmxt xscale""
TARGET_CC_ARCH = "-mcpu=xscale -mtune=iwmmxt"
TARGET_ARCH = "arm"
PACKAGE_ARCH="xscale"
                </screen>

        <para>We tell OpenEmbedded that we build for the ARM platform and
        optimize for xscale and iwmmxt.</para>

        <screen>
INHERIT += " package_ipk debian"
TARGET_OS  = "linux"
TARGET_FPU = "soft"
DISTRO = "secret-disro"
DISTRO_NAME = "secret-distro"
DISTRO_VERSION = "x.y.z"
DISTRO_TYPE = "release"
                </screen>

        <para>Create a distribution ad-hoc as well. We tell OpenEmbedded that
        we build for linux and glibc using soft float as fpu. If your
        toolchain is a uclibc toolchain you will need to set
        <command>TARGET_OS</command> to linux-uclibc.</para>

        <screen>
export CC="${CCACHE}arm-linux-gcc-3.4.4 ${HOST_CC_ARCH}"

export RANLIB="arm-linux-ranlib"
export STRIP="arm-linux-strip"
                </screen>

        <para>The above variables replace the ones from
        <emphasis>bitbake.conf</emphasis>. This will make OpenEmbedded use the
        prebuilt toolchain.</para>

        <screen>
#
# point OE to the lib and include directory
#
TARGET_CPPFLAGS_append = " -I${PRE_BUILT}/include "
TARGET_LDFLAGS_prepend = " -L${PRE_BUILT}/qt2/lib -L${PRE_BUILT}/lib \

QPEDIR = "${PRE_BUILT}"
palmtopdir = "/opt/Qtopia"
palmqtdir  = "/opt/Qtopia"
                </screen>

        <para>We will add the <command>PRE_BUILT</command> libraries to the
        include and library paths. And the same is done for the special
        version of Qt we have in your <command>PRE_BUILT</command>
        directory.</para>

        <screen>
ASSUME_PROVIDED += " virtual/${TARGET_PREFIX}gcc "

ASSUME_PROVIDED += " virtual/qte "
ASSUME_PROVIDED += " virtual/libqpe "
ASSUME_PROVIDED += " libqpe-opie "
                </screen>

        <para>Now we have told <application>BitBake</application> that the C
        library, compiler and Qtopia is already provided. These lines will
        avoid building binutils, gcc initial, glibc, gcc.</para>

        <screen>
<command>source</command> build_source
<command>bitbake</command> your-killer-app
                </screen>

        <para>You should be able to create the packages you want to using the
        prebuilt toolchain now.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Useful hints</title>

      <para>If you have more prebuilt libraries you need to add additional
      <command>ASSUME_PROVIDED</command> lines to your
      <emphasis>local.conf</emphasis>. Using <command>bitbake -vvv
      PACKAGE</command> you can easily see the package names you could
      <command>ASSUME_PROVIDED</command> if you have some prebuilt.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Issues with this approach</title>

      <screen>
NOTE: Couldn't find shared library provider for libqtopia.so.1
NOTE: Couldn't find shared library provider for libqtopia2.so.2
NOTE: Couldn't find shared library provider for libqpe.so.1
NOTE: Couldn't find shared library provider for libpthread.so.0
NOTE: Couldn't find shared library provider for libstdc++.so.6
NOTE: Couldn't find shared library provider for libqte.so.2
NOTE: Couldn't find shared library provider for libgcc_s.so.1
NOTE: Couldn't find shared library provider for libc.so.6
NOTE: Couldn't find shared library provider for libm.so.6
</screen>

      <para>OpenEmbedded tries to automatically add run-time dependencies
      (RDEPENDS) to the package. It uses the <emphasis><link
      linkend="shlibs">shlibs</link></emphasis> system to do add them, in this
      case it was not able to find packages providing these libraries as they
      are prebuilt. This means they will not be added to the RDEPENDS of the
      just created package. The result can be fatal. If you use OpenEmbedded
      to create images you will end up with a image without a libc being
      installed. This will lead to a fatal failure. To workaround this issue
      you could create a package for the metadata to install every needed
      library and use ${BOOTSTRAP_EXTRA_RDEPENDS} to make sure this package is
      installed when creating images.</para>
      
      <para>However, the correct way to resolve this is to provide explicit 
      mapping using ASSUME_SHLIBS variable. For example, for the libraries 
      above (partial):
      <screen>
ASSUME_SHLIBS = "libqtopia2.so.2:qtopia2_2.4 libc.so.6:libc"
</screen>
      The format is shlib_file_name:package[_version]. If a version is specified it will be
      used as the minimal (>=) version for the dependency.</para>
