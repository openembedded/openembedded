.SH NAME
ether-wake \- A tool to send a Wake-On-LAN "Magic Packet"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ether-wake
.RI [ options ] " Host-ID"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the usage of the
.B ether-wake
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBether-wake\fP is a program that generates and transmits a Wake-On-LAN 
(WOL) "Magic Packet", used for restarting machines that have been
soft-powered-down (ACPI D3-warm state). It generates the standard
AMD Magic Packet format, optionally with a password included.  The
single required parameter is a station (MAC) address or a host ID that can
be translated to a MAC address by an
.BR ethers (5)
database specified in
.BR nsswitch.conf (5)
.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBether-wake\fP needs a single dash (´-´) in front of options.
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-b
Send the wake-up packet to the broadcast address.
.TP
.B \-D
Increase the Debug Level.
.TP
.B \-i ifname
Use interface ifname instead of the default "eth0".
.TP
.B \-p passwd
Append a four or six byte password to the packet. Only a few adapters
need or support this. A six byte password may be specified in Ethernet hex
format (00:22:44:66:88:aa) or four byte dotted decimal (192.168.1.1) format.
A four byte password must use the dotted decimal format.

.TP
.B \-V
Show the program version information.

.SH EXIT STATUS
This program returns 0 on success.
A permission failures (e.g. run as a non-root user) results in an exit
status of 2.  Unrecognized or invalid parameters result in an exit
status of 3.  Failure to retrieve network interface information or send
a packet will result in an exit status of 1.

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR arp (8).
.br
.SH SECURITY
On some non-Linux systems dropping root capability allows the process to be
dumped, traced or debugged.
If someone traces this program, they get control of a raw socket.
Linux handles this safely, but beware when porting this program.

Corporation for use with the Scyld(\*(Tm) Beowulf System.
