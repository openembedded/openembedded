+# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
+# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
+# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
+#
+# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
+# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
+# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
+# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
+# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
+# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
+# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
+#
+# $ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
+# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
+#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
+#
+# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
+# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
+# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
+# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
+#
+# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
+# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
+#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
+# and then we would define $MISSING as
+#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
+# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
+# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
+# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
+# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
+#
+# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an

+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+			  [$ac_default_prefix]
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+			  [PREFIX]
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.

+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+			  [$ac_default_prefix]
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+			  [PREFIX]
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.

+\`configure' configures openmoko-browser 0.0.1 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+			  [$ac_default_prefix]
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+			  [PREFIX]
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',

+Usage: ${PROGRAM} [OPTION]... [FILENAME]
+Generates a header file from an XML source file.
+
+It grabs all strings between <_translatable_node> and its end tag in
+XML files. Read manpage (man ${PROGRAM}) for more info.
+
+      --type=TYPE   Specify the file type of FILENAME. Currently supports:
+                    "gettext/glade", "gettext/ini", "gettext/keys"
+                    "gettext/rfc822deb", "gettext/schemas",
+                    "gettext/scheme", "gettext/xml"
+  -l, --local       Writes output into current working directory
+                    (conflicts with --update)
+      --update      Writes output into the same directory the source file 
+                    reside (conflicts with --local)
+      --srcdir      Root of the source tree
+  -v, --version     Output version information and exit
+  -h, --help        Display this help and exit
+  -q, --quiet       Quiet mode
+
+Report bugs to http://bugzilla.gnome.org/ (product name "$PACKAGE")

+Usage: ${PROGRAM} [OPTION]... PO_DIRECTORY FILENAME OUTPUT_FILE
+Generates an output file that includes some localized attributes from an
+untranslated source file.
+
+Mandatory options: (exactly one must be specified)
+  -b, --ba-style         includes translations in the bonobo-activation style
+  -d, --desktop-style    includes translations in the desktop style
+  -k, --keys-style       includes translations in the keys style
+  -s, --schemas-style    includes translations in the schemas style
+  -r, --rfc822deb-style  includes translations in the RFC822 style
+  -x, --xml-style        includes translations in the standard xml style
+
+Other options:
+  -u, --utf8             convert all strings to UTF-8 before merging 
+                         (default for everything except RFC822 style)
+  -p, --pass-through     deprecated, does nothing and issues a warning
+  -m, --multiple-output  output one localized file per locale, instead of 
+	                 a single file containing all localized elements
+  -c, --cache=FILE       specify cache file name
+                         (usually \$top_builddir/po/.intltool-merge-cache)
+  -q, --quiet            suppress most messages
+      --help             display this help and exit
+      --version          output version information and exit
+
+Report bugs to http://bugzilla.gnome.org/ (product name "$PACKAGE")
+or send email to <xml-i18n-tools\@gnome.org>.

+Usage: ${PROGRAM} [OPTION]... LANGCODE
+Updates PO template files and merge them with the translations.
+
+Mode of operation (only one is allowed):
+  -p, --pot                   generate the PO template only
+  -s, --headers               generate the header files in POTFILES.in
+  -m, --maintain              search for left out files from POTFILES.in
+  -r, --report                display a status report for the module
+  -d, --dist                  merge LANGCODE.po with existing PO template
+
+Extra options:
+  -g, --gettext-package=NAME  override PO template name, useful with --pot
+  -o, --output-file=FILE      write merged translation to FILE
+  -x, --verbose               display lots of feedback
+      --help                  display this help and exit
+      --version               output version information and exit
+
+Examples of use:
+${PROGRAM} --pot    just create a new PO template
+${PROGRAM} xy       create new PO template and merge xy.po with it
+
+Report bugs to http://bugzilla.gnome.org/ (product name "$PACKAGE")
+or send email to <xml-i18n-tools\@gnome.org>.

+  -R[ ]LIBDIR       add LIBDIR to the runtime path of programs and libraries
+  -static           do not do any dynamic linking of libtool libraries

+only library objects (\`.lo' files) may be specified, and \`-rpath' is
+required, except when creating a convenience library.
