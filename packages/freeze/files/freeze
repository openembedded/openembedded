# export PKGDIR=<location of openembedded package source>
# export DISTRO=<distro being frozen>
# freeze {directories}

# 	$FROZEN_DIR/$DISTRO-bbfiles.conf
#	  defines BBFILES to a list of all the .bb files required
#
#	$FROZEN_DIR/$DISTRO-packages.conf
#	  defines BBFILES to a list of the directories containing
#	  those bb files.
#
# The output path definitions use ${PKGDIR} (literally)
#
