+File: gst/gstbin.c
+Revision: 1.41
+Date: Dec 16, 2000
+Reviewer: Erik Walthinsen <omega@cse.ogi.edu>

+Line 20:
+#define GST_DEBUG_ENABLED
+
+Shouldn't be here, DEBUG should be enabled globally.  May leave until
+scheduling changes are done.
+
+
+-----
+Lines 24-25:
+#include "gstsrc.h"
+#include "gstconnection.h"
+
+These may go away entirely with scheduling changes complete.  
+Differentiation is based on element's pads.
+
+
+-----
+Lines 52-54:
+/* Bin signals and args */
+enum {
+  OBJECT_ADDED,
+
+Bin needs a lot more signals, there are a lot of events that may need to
+be trapped.
+
+
+-----
+Line 117: (gst_bin_class_init)
+  gstelement_class->elementfactory =    gst_elementfactory_find("bin");
+
+Not sure this is such a great idea.  I thought the GstElement code did
+this kind of stuff?
+
+
+-----
+Lines 127-128: (gst_bin_init)
+// FIXME temporary testing measure
+//  bin->use_cothreads = TRUE;
+
+Need to work out how the cothreads force stuff works.  need_cothreads is
+the private state that create_plan figures out, use_cothreads is the
+argument that the user sets.  Since create_plan works out if cothreads are
+needed, and scheduling can't be done without them if they are really
+needed, perhaps we should rename use_cothreads to force_cothreads.  If
+FALSE, create_plan decides.  If TRUE, cothreads are forced on.  Then
+again, there may be some random case where create_plan says to use
+cothreads when they're not strictly required.  Not sure if we want to
+enable the user to force cothreads *off*.  I suppose the user may know
+better, given specific plugins.  Maybe a second argument
+force_cothreads_disable.
+
+
+-----
+Lines 131-145: (gst_bin_new)
+. . .
+
+It seems to make sense to keep this function, since it's part of the main
+API and not a plugin, but if we come up with some better way of creating
+plugins and such, this may go away.  It stays for now.
+
+
+-----
+Lines 164-166: (gst_bin_add)
+  // must be NULL or PAUSED state in order to modify bin
+  g_return_if_fail ((GST_STATE (bin) == GST_STATE_NULL) ||
+                    (GST_STATE (bin) == GST_STATE_PAUSED));
+
+Live pipeline modification needs some serious thought, along with the rest
+of the potential state-transition cases.  This check looks sane in the
+sense that you really shouldn't be in running state and change the bin
+contents, since create_plan won't be run.  But we don't actually re-run
+create_plan (or maybe it should be update_plan, and we keep a log of the
+changes since last plan to optimize the update?), so if someone messes
+with the bin during PAUSED state, we're looking forward to major disaster.
+
+
+-----
+Line 168: (gst_bin_add)
+  bin->children = g_list_append (bin->children, element);
+
+Should we be appending or prepending?  Append is slow, but it's a matter
+of whether you want to spend the time at setup or later, with setup being
+preferable.  We'll walk the child list quite often during runtime, so the
+time spent putting the element in the right place up front is done only
+once.  Then again, does the order of the elements in the child list really
+matter?
+
+
+-----
+Lines 172-174: (gst_bin_add)
+  /* we know we have at least one child, we just added one... */
+//  if (GST_STATE(element) < GST_STATE_READY)
+//    gst_bin_change_state_norecurse(bin,GST_STATE_READY);
+
+This is another part of the state management issue.  The behavior of Bins
+seems to be leaning away from this style, which is why it's commented out,
+but it's something to keep in mind when working on the state system.
+
+
+-----
+Lines 204-206: (gst_bin_remove)
+  /* if we're down to zero children, force state to NULL */
+  if (bin->numchildren == 0)
+    gst_element_set_state (GST_ELEMENT (bin), GST_STATE_NULL);
+
+Also suspect from the state management perspective, except this one isn't
+commented out.
+
+
+-----
+Line 226: (gst_bin_change_state)
+//  g_return_val_if_fail(bin->numchildren != 0, GST_STATE_FAILURE);
+
+Should this be uncommented?  It makes sense that a bin can't change state unless it's got children,
+though we probably should check to see what state change is actually occuring before blindly failing.
+
+
+-----
+Lines 241-243 (gst_bin_change_state)
+      case GST_STATE_ASYNC:
+        g_print("gstbin: child '%s' is changing state asynchronously\n", gst_element_get_name (child));
+        break;
+
+Obviously some work needs to be done on async state management.  Probably need to have the Bin attach to
+one of the element's signals.  This assumes that the element will get to run at some point in the
+future, or is capable of doing things in a separate context.
+
+
+-----
+Lines 250-257: (gst_bin_change_state)
+  if (GST_STATE_PENDING (element) == GST_STATE_READY) {
+    GstObject *parent;
+ 
+    parent = gst_object_get_parent (GST_OBJECT (element));
+  
+    if (!parent || !GST_IS_BIN (parent))
+      gst_bin_create_plan (bin);
+  }
+
+First of all, this code is run even if there is a failed or async reply from one of the child elements.
+Second problem is that it will call create_plan only in the NULL->READY and PLAYING->READY cases.  If
+PAUSED is going to be a time for allowing changes to the pipeline, we need to update the plan somehow on
+PAUSED->PLAYING state.  And calling create_plan in the PLAYING->READY case isn't actually that useful...
+
+
+-----
+Line 263-271: (gst_bin_change_state_norecurse)
+. . .
+
+Is this really necessary?  Are any users going to want to call this function?  If not, then we can move
+the body of this function into gst_bin_change_state.
+
+
+-----
+Line 273-305: (gst_bin_set_state_type)
+. . .
+
+Is this function ever going to be used by anything?  I tend to think not...
+
+
+-----
+Line 356-393: (gst_bin_get_by_name)
+. . .
+
+Should this be renamed to gst_bin_get_child_by_name() ?
+
+
+-----
+Line 464-471: (gst_bin_use_cothreads)
+. . .
+
+This should be removed in favor of an argument or two?  I think so.

+ - metadata associated with that memory such as timestamps and caps.
+
+It is the primary means of transfering data between pads and elements.
+
+GstBufferList expands on GstBuffer to allow multiple GstBuffers (conceptually 
+organized in a list) to be treated as a multiple groups of GstBuffers. This allows
+for the following extra functionality:
+
+ - A logical GstBuffer (called a group) can consist of disjoint memory each with
+   their own copy/free and metadata. Logicallty the group should be treated as
+   one single GstBuffer.
+ - Multiple groups can be put into one bufferlist. This allows for a single
+   method call to pass multiple (logical) buffers downstream.
+
+
+Use cases
+---------
+
+A typical use case for multimedia pipelines is to append or remove 'headers'
+from packets of data.
+
+* Generating RTP packets from h264 video
+
+ We receive as input a GstBuffer with an encoded h264 image and we need to
+ create RTP packets containing this h264 data as the payload. We typically need
+ to fragment the h264 data into multiple packets, each with their own RTP and
+ payload specific header.
+
+                       +-------+-------+---------------------------+--------+
+  input H264 buffer:   | NALU1 | NALU2 |  .....                    | NALUx  |
+                       +-------+-------+---------------------------+--------+
+                             |
+                             V
+                       +-+ +-------+  +-+ +-------+            +-+ +-------+
+  output bufferlist:   | | | NALU1 |  | | | NALU2 |   ....     | | | NALUx |
+                       +-+ +-------+  +-+ +-------+            +-+ +-------+
+ 
+                       \-----------/  \-----------/
+                         group 1        group 2 
+
+ The output bufferlist consists of x groups consisting of an RTP payload header
+ and a subbuffer of the original input H264 buffer. Since the rtp headers and
+ the h264 data don't need to be contiguous in memory, we can avoid to memcpy the
+ h264 data into the rtp packets.
+
+ Since we can generate a bufferlist with multiple groups, we can push all the
+ RTP packets for the input data to the next element in one operation.
+
+ A typical udpsink will then use something like sendmsg to send the groups on
+ the network inside one UDP packet. This will further avoid having to memcpy
+ data into contiguous memory.
+
+
+API
+---
+
+The GstBufferList is an opaque data structure and is operated on using an
+iterator. It derives from GstMiniObject so that it has basic refcounting and
+copy/free functions.
+
+The bufferlist is writable when its refcount is 1 and it's not marked as
+readonly. A writable bufferlist means that elements can be added and removed
+form the list but it does not mean that the actual buffers in the list are
+writable.
+
+To modify the data in the buffers of the bufferlist, both the list and the
+buffer must be writable.
+
+Methods exist for navigating the groups in the list and the buffers inside a
+group. 
+
+
+Metadata
+--------
+
+Each of the buffers inside the bufferlist can have metadata assiociated with it.
+
+The metadata of the bufferlist is always the metadata of the first buffer of the
+first group in the bufferlist. This means that:
+
+  - Before pushing the list to a pad, negotiation happens with (only) the caps of
+    the first buffer in the list. Caps of other buffers is ignore.
+
+  - synchronisation happens on the timestamp of the first buffer in the list.
+
+This allows for efficient (re)timestamping and re-typing (caps) of a group of
+buffers without having to modify each of the buffer's metadata.

+Latency
+-------
+
+The latency is the time it takes for a sample captured at timestamp 0 to reach the
+sink. This time is measured against the clock in the pipeline. For pipelines
+where the only elements that synchronize against the clock are the sinks, the
+latency is always 0 since no other element is delaying the buffer.
+
+For pipelines with live sources, a latency is introduced, mostly because of the
+way a live source works. Consider an audio source, it will start capturing the
+first sample at time 0. If the source pushes buffers with 44100 samples at a
+time at 44100Hz it will have collected the buffer at second 1.
+Since the timestamp of the buffer is 0 and the time of the clock is now >= 1
+second, the sink will drop this buffer because it is too late.
+Without any latency compensation in the sink, all buffers will be dropped.
+
+The situation becomes more complex in the presence of:
+
+ - 2 live sources connected to 2 live sinks with different latencies
+    * audio/video capture with synchronized live preview.
+    * added latencies due to effects (delays, resamplers...)
+ - 1 live source connected to 2 live sinks
+    * firewire DV
+    * RTP, with added latencies because of jitter buffers.
+ - mixed live source and non-live source scenarios.
+    * synchronized audio capture with non-live playback. (overdubs,..)
+ - clock slaving in the sinks due to the live sources providing their own
+   clocks.
+
+To perform the needed latency corrections in the above scenarios, we must
+develop an algorithm to calculate a global latency for the pipeline. The
+algorithm must be extensible so that it can optimize the latency at runtime. 
+It must also be possible to disable or tune the algorithm based on specific
+application needs (required minimal latency).
+
+
+Pipelines without latency compensation
+--------------------------------------
+
+We show some examples to demonstrate the problem of latency in typical
+capture pipelines.
+
+- Example 1
+
+  An audio capture/playback pipeline.
+
+   asrc: audio source, provides a clock
+   asink audio sink, provides a clock
+
+   .--------------------------.
+   | pipeline                 |
+   | .------.      .-------.  |
+   | | asrc |      | asink |  |
+   | |     src -> sink     |  |
+   | '------'      '-------'  |
+   '--------------------------'
+
+ NULL->READY:
+  asink: NULL->READY: probes device, returns SUCCESS 
+  asrc: NULL->READY:  probes device, returns SUCCESS
+
+ READY->PAUSED:
+  asink: READY:->PAUSED open device, returns ASYNC 
+  asrc: READY->PAUSED:  open device, returns NO_PREROLL
+
+  * Since the source is a live source, it will only produce data in the
+    PLAYING state. To note this fact, it returns NO_PREROLL from the state change
+    function.
+  * This sink returns ASYNC because it can only complete the state change to
+    PAUSED when it receives the first buffer.
+
+  At this point the pipeline is not processing data and the clock is not
+  running. Unless a new action is performed on the pipeline, this situation will
+  never change.
+
+ PAUSED->PLAYING:
+  asrc clock selected because it is the most upstream clock provider. asink can
+  only provide a clock when it received the first buffer and configured the
+  device with the samplerate in the caps.
+
+  asink: PAUSED:->PLAYING, sets pending state to PLAYING, returns ASYNC becaus
+                         it is not prerolled. The sink will commit state to
+			 PLAYING when it prerolls.
+  asrc: PAUSED->PLAYING: starts pushing buffers.
+
+  * since the sink is still performing a state change from READY -> PAUSED, it
+    remains ASYNC. The pending state will be set to PLAYING.
+  * The clock starts running as soon as all the elements have been set to
+    PLAYING.
+  * the source is a live source with a latency. Since it is synchronized with
+    the clock, it will produce a buffer with timestamp 0 and duration D after
+    time D, ie. it will only be able to produce the last sample of the buffer
+    (with timestamp D) at time D. This latency depends on the size of the
+    buffer.
+  * the sink will receive the buffer with timestamp 0 at time >= D. At this
+    point the buffer is too late already and might be dropped. This state of
+    constantly dropping data will not change unless a constant latency
+    correction is added to the incomming buffer timestamps.
+
+  The problem is due to the fact that the sink is set to (pending) PLAYING
+  without being prerolled, which only happens in live pipelines. 
+
+- Example 2
+
+  An audio/video capture/playback pipeline. We capture both audio and video and
+  have them played back synchronized again.
+
+   asrc: audio source, provides a clock
+   asink audio sink, provides a clock
+   vsrc: video source
+   vsink video sink
+
+   .--------------------------.
+   | pipeline                 |
+   | .------.      .-------.  |
+   | | asrc |      | asink |  |
+   | |     src -> sink     |  |
+   | '------'      '-------'  |
+   | .------.      .-------.  |
+   | | vsrc |      | vsink |  |
+   | |     src -> sink     |  |
+   | '------'      '-------'  |
+   '--------------------------'
+
+  The state changes happen in the same way as example 1. Both sinks end up with
+  pending state of PLAYING and a return value of ASYNC until they receive the
+  first buffer.
+
+  For audio and video to be played in sync, both sinks must compensate for the
+  latency of its source but must also use exactly the same latency correction.  
+
+  Suppose asrc has a latency of 20ms and vsrc a latency of 33ms, the total
+  latency in the pipeline has to be at least 33ms. This also means that the
+  pipeline must have at least a 33 - 20 = 13ms buffering on the audio stream or
+  else the audio src will underrun while the audiosink waits for the previous
+  sample to play.
+
+- Example 3
+
+  An example of the combination of a non-live (file) and a live source (vsrc) 
+  connected to live sinks (vsink, sink). 
+
+   .--------------------------.
+   | pipeline                 |
+   | .------.      .-------.  |
+   | | file |      | sink  |  |
+   | |     src -> sink     |  |
+   | '------'      '-------'  |
+   | .------.      .-------.  |
+   | | vsrc |      | vsink |  |
+   | |     src -> sink     |  |
+   | '------'      '-------'  |
+   '--------------------------'
+
+  The state changes happen in the same way as example 1. Except sink will be
+  able to preroll (commit its state to PAUSED).
+
+  In this case sink will have no latency but vsink will. The total latency
+  should be that of vsink.
+
+  Note that because of the presence of a live source (vsrc), the pipeline can be
+  set to playing before sink is able to preroll. Without compensation for the
+  live source, this might lead to synchronisation problems because the latency
+  should be configured in the element before it can go to PLAYING.
+
+
+- Example 4
+
+  An example of the combination of a non-live and a live source. The non-live
+  source is connected to a live sink and the live source to a non-live sink.
+
+   .--------------------------.
+   | pipeline                 |
+   | .------.      .-------.  |
+   | | file |      | sink  |  |
+   | |     src -> sink     |  |
+   | '------'      '-------'  |
+   | .------.      .-------.  |
+   | | vsrc |      | files |  |
+   | |     src -> sink     |  |
+   | '------'      '-------'  |
+   '--------------------------'
+
+  The state changes happen in the same way as example 3. Sink will be
+  able to preroll (commit its state to PAUSED). files will not be able to
+  preroll.
+
+  sink will have no latency since it is not connected to a live source. files
+  does not do synchronisation so it does not care about latency.
+
+  The total latency in the pipeline is 0. The vsrc captures in sync with the
+  playback in sink.
+
+  As in example 3, sink can only be set to PLAYING after it successfully
+  prerolled.
+
+
+State Changes revised
+---------------------
+
+As a first step in a generic solution we propose to modify the state changes so
+that no sink is set to PLAYING before it is prerolled.
+
+In order to do this, the pipeline (at the GstBin level) keeps track of all
+elements that require preroll (the ones that return ASYNC from the state
+change). These elements posted a ASYNC_START message without a matching
+ASYNC_DONE message.
+
+The pipeline will not change the state of the elements that are still doing an
+ASYNC state change.
+
+When an ASYNC element prerolls, it commits its state to PAUSED and posts an
+ASYNC_DONE message. The pipeline notices this ASYNC_DONE message and matches it
+with the ASYNC_START message it cached for the corresponding element. 
+
+When all ASYNC_START messages are matched with an ASYNC_DONE message, the
+pipeline proceeds with setting the elements to the final state again.
+
+The base time of the element was already set by the pipeline when it changed the
+NO_PREROLL element to PLAYING. This operation has to be performed in the
+separate async state change thread (like the one currently used for going from
+PAUSED->PLAYING in a non-live pipeline).
+
+implications:
+
+ - the current async_play vmethod in basesink can be deprecated since we now
+   always call the state change function when going from PAUSED->PLAYING. We
+   keep this method however to remain backward compatible.
+
+
+Latency compensation
+--------------------
+
+As an extension to the revised state changes we can perform latency calculation
+and compensation before we proceed to the PLAYING state. 
+
+When the pipeline collected all ASYNC_DONE messages it can calculate the global
+latency as follows:
+
+  - perform a latency query on all sinks.
+  - latency = MAX (all min latencies) 
+  - if MIN (all max latencies) < latency we have an impossible situation and we
+    must generate an error indicating that this pipeline cannot be played. This
+    usually means that there is not enough buffering in some chain of the
+    pipeline. A queue can be added to those chains.
+
+The sinks gather this information with a LATENCY query upstream. Intermediate
+elements pass the query upstream and add the amount of latency they add to the
+result.
+
+ex1:
+  sink1: [20 - 20]
+  sink2: [33 - 40]
+
+  MAX (20, 33) = 33
+  MIN (20, 40) = 20 < 33 -> impossible
+
+ex2:
+  sink1: [20 - 50]
+  sink2: [33 - 40]
+
+  MAX (20, 33) = 33
+  MIN (50, 40) = 40 >= 33 -> latency = 33
+
+The latency is set on the pipeline by sending a LATENCY event to the sinks
+in the pipeline. This event configures the total latency on the sinks. The
+sink forwards this LATENCY event upstream so that intermediate elements can
+configure themselves as well.
+
+After this step, the pipeline continues setting the pending state on its
+elements.
+
+A sink adds the latency value, received in the LATENCY event, to
+the times used for synchronizing against the clock. This will effectively
+delay the rendering of the buffer with the required latency. Since this delay is
+the same for all sinks, all sinks will render data relatively synchronised.
+
+
+Flushing a playing pipeline
+---------------------------
+
+Using the new state change mechanism we can implement resynchronisation after an
+uncontrolled FLUSH in (part of) a pipeline. Indeed, when a flush is performed on
+a PLAYING live element, a new base time must be distributed to this element.
+
+A flush in a pipeline can happen in the following cases:
+
+ - flushing seek in the pipeline
+    - performed by the application on the pipeline
+    - performed by the application on an element
+ - flush preformed by an element
+    - after receiving a navigation event (DVD, ...)
+
+When a playing sink is flushed by a FLUSH_START event, an ASYNC_START  message is
+posted by the element. As part of the message, the fact that the element got
+flushed is included. The element also goes to a pending PAUSED state and has to
+be set to the PLAYING state again later.
+
+The ASYNC_START message is kept by the parent bin. When the element prerolls,
+it posts an ASYNC_DONE message. 
+
+When all ASYNC_START messages are matched with an ASYNC_DONE message, the bin
+will capture a new base_time from the clock and will bring all the sinks back to
+PLAYING after setting the new base time on them. It's also possible
+to perform additional latency calculations and adjustments before doing this. 
+
+
+Dynamically adjusting latency
+-----------------------------
+
+An element that want to change the latency in the pipeline can do this by
+posting a LATENCY message on the bus. This message instructs the pipeline to:
+
+ - query the latency in the pipeline (which might now have changed) with a
+   LATENCY query.
+ - redistribute a new global latency to all elements with a LATENCY event.
+
+A use case where the latency in a pipeline can change could be a network element
+that observes an increased inter packet arrival jitter or excessive packet loss
+and decides to increase its internal buffering (and thus the latency). The
+element must post a LATENCY message and perform the additional latency
+adjustments when it receives the LATENCY event from the downstream peer element.
+
+In a similar way can the latency be decreased when network conditions are
+improving again.
+
+Latency adjustments will introduce glitches in playback in the sinks and must
+only be performed in special conditions.

+What to do when a plugin is missing
+===================================
+
+The mechanism and API described in this document requires GStreamer core and
+gst-plugins-base versions >= 0.10.12. Further information on some aspects of
+this document can be found in the libgstbaseutils API reference.
+
+We only discuss playback pipelines for now.
+
+A three step process:
+
+1) GStreamer level
+
+ - elements will use a "missing-plugin" element message to report missing
+   plugins, with the following fields set:
+
+     - type: (string) { "urisource", "urisink", "decoder", "encoder", "element" }
+         (we do not distinguish between demuxer/decoders/parsers etc.)
+     - detail: (string) or (caps) depending on the type { ANY }
+         ex: "mms, "mmsh", "audio/x-mp3,rate=48000,..."
+     - name: (string) { ANY }
+         ex: "MMS protocol handler",..
+
+ - missing uri handler 
+  
+  ex. mms://foo.bar/file.asf
+
+  When no protocol handler is installed for mms://, the application will not be
+  able to instantiate an element for that uri (gst_element_make_from_uri()
+  returns NULL).
+
+  Playbin will post a "missing-plugin" element message with the type set to 
+  "urisource", detail set to "mms". Optionally the friendly name can be filled
+  in as well.
+
+ - missing typefind function
+
+  We don't recognize the type of the file, this should normally not happen
+  because all the typefinders are in the basic GStreamer installation.
+  There is not much useful information we can give about how to resolve this 
+  issue. It is possible to use the first N bytes of the data to determine the
+  type (and needed plugin) on the server. We don't explore this option in this
+  document yet, but the proposal is flexible enough to accomodate this in the
+  future should the need arise.
+
+ - missing demuxer
+
+  Typically after running typefind on the data we determine the type of the 
+  file. If there is no plugin found for the type, a "missing-plugin" element
+  message is posted by decodebin with the following fields: Type set to
+  "decoder", detail set to the caps for witch no plugin was found. Optionally
+  the friendly name can be filled in as well.
+
+ - missing decoder 
+
+  The demuxer will dynamically create new pads with specific caps while it 
+  figures out the contents of the container format. Decodebin tries to find the
+  decoders for these formats in the registry. If there is no decoder found, a
+  "missing-plugin" element message is posted by decodebin with the following
+  fields: Type set to "decoder", detail set to the caps for which no plugin
+  was found. Optionally the friendly name can be filled in as well. There is
+  no distinction made between the missing demuxer and decoder at the
+  application level.
+
+ - missing element
+
+  Decodebin and playbin will create a set of helper elements when they set up
+  their decoding pipeline. These elements are typically colorspace, sample rate,
+  audio sinks,... Their presence on the system is required for the functionality
+  of decodebin. It is typically a package dependency error if they are not
+  present but in case of a corrupted system the following "missing-plugin"
+  element message will be emitted: type set to "element", detail set to the
+  element factory name and the friendly name optionally set to a description
+  of the element's functionality in the decoding pipeline.
+
+ Except for reporting the missing plugins, no further policy is enforced at the
+ GStreamer level. It is up to the application to decide whether a missing
+ plugin constitutes a problem or not.
+
+
+2) application level
+
+ The application's job is to listen for the "missing-plugin" element messages
+ and to decide on a policy to handle them. Following cases exist:
+
+ - partially missing plugins
+
+ The application will be able to complete a state change to PAUSED but there 
+ will be a "missing-plugin" element message on the GstBus. 
+
+ This means that it will be possible to play back part of the media file but not
+ all of it. 
+
+ For example: suppose we have an .avi file with mp3 audio and divx video. If we 
+ have the mp3 audio decoder but not the divx video decoder, it will be possible
+ to play only the audio part but not the video part. For an audio playback
+ application, this is not a problem but a video player might want to decide on:
+
+   - require the use to install the additionally required plugins. 
+   - inform the user that only the audio will be played back
+   - ask the user if it should download the additional codec or only play the 
+     audio part.
+   - ...
+
+ - completely unplayable stream
+
+ The application will receive an ERROR message from GStreamer informing it that
+ playback stopped (before it could reach PAUSED). This happens because none of
+ the streams is connected to a decoder. The error code and domain should be one
+ of the following in this case:
+    - GST_CORE_ERROR_MISSING_PLUGIN (domain: GST_CORE_ERROR)
+    - GST_STREAM_ERROR_CODEC_NOT_FOUND (domain: GST_STREAM_ERROR)
+
+ The application can then see that there are a set of "missing-plugin" element
+ messages on the GstBus and can decide to trigger the download procedure. It
+ does that as described in the following section.
+
+ "missing-plugin" element messages can be identified using the function
+ gst_is_missing_plugin_message().
+
+
+3) Plugin download stage
+
+  At this point the application has
+    - collected one or more "missing-plugin" element messages
+    - made a decision that additional plugins should be installed
+
+  It will call a GStreamer utility function to convert each "missing-plugin"
+  message into an identifier string describing the missing capability. This is
+  done using the function gst_missing_plugin_message_get_installer_detail().
+
+  The application will then pass these strings to gst_install_plugins_async()
+  or gst_install_plugins_sync() to initiate the download. See the API
+  documentation there (libgstbaseutils, part of gst-plugins-base) for more
+  details.
+
+  When new plugins have been installed, the application will have to initiate
+  a re-scan of the GStreamer plugin registry using gst_update_registry().
+
+
+4) Format of the (UTF-8) string ID passed to the external installer system
+
+  The string is made up of several fields, separated by '|' characters.
+  The fields are:
+
+    - plugin system identifier, ie. "gstreamer"
+      This identifier determines the format of the rest of the detail string.
+      Automatic plugin installers should not process detail strings with
+      unknown identifiers. This allows other plugin-based libraries to use
+      the same mechanism for their automatic plugin installation needs, or
+      for the format to be changed should it turn out to be insufficient.
+
+    - plugin system version, e.g. "0.10"
+      This is required so that when there is a GStreamer-0.12 or GStreamer-1.0
+      at somem point in future, the different major versions can still co-exist
+      and use the same plugin install mechanism in the same way.
+
+    - application identifier, e.g. "totem"
+      This may also be in the form of "pid/12345" if the program name can't
+      be obtained for some reason.
+
+    - human-readable localised description of the required component,
+      e.g. "Vorbis audio decoder"
+
+    - identifier string for the required component, e.g.
+
+         - urisource-$(PROTOCOL_REQUIRED)
+             e.g. urisource-http or urisource-mms
+
+         - element-$(ELEMENT_REQUIRED),
+             e.g. element-ffmpegcolorspace
+
+         - decoder-$(CAPS_REQUIRED)
+             e.g. decoder-audio/x-vorbis or
+                  decoder-application/ogg or
+                  decoder-audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)4 or
+                  decoder-video/mpeg, systemstream=(boolean)true, mpegversion=(int)2
+
+         - encoder-$(CAPS_REQUIRED)
+             e.g. encoder-audio/x-vorbis
+
+    - optional further fields not yet specified
+
+
+  An entire ID string might then look like this, for example:
+
+    gstreamer|0.10|totem|Vorbis audio decoder|decoder-audio/x-vorbis
+
+  Plugin installers parsing this ID string should expect further fields also
+  separated by '|' symbols and either ignore them, warn the user, or error
+  out when encountering them.
+ 
+  The human-readable description string is provided by the libgstbaseutils
+  library that can be found in gst-plugins-base versions >= 0.10.12 and can
+  also be used by demuxers to find out the codec names for taglists from given
+  caps in a unified and consistent way.
+
+  Applications can create these detail strings using the function
+  gst_missing_plugin_message_get_installer_detail() on a given missing-plugin
+  message.
+
+
+5) Using missing-plugin messages for error reporting:
+
+  Missing-plugin messages are also useful for error reporting purposes, either
+  in the case where the application does not support libgimme-codec, or the
+  external installer is not available or not able to install the required
+  plugins.
+
+  When creating error messages, applications may use the function
+  gst_missing_plugin_message_get_description() to obtain a possibly translated
+  description from each missing-plugin message (e.g. "Matroska demuxer" or
+  "Theora video depayloader"). This can be used to report to the user exactly
+  what it is that is missing.
+
+
+6) Notes for packagers
+
+ - An easy way to introspect plugin .so files is:
+
+     $ gst-inspect --print-plugin-auto-install-info /path/to/libgstfoo.so
+
+   The output will be something like:
+
+     decoder-audio/x-vorbis
+     element-vorbisdec
+     element-vorbisenc
+     element-vorbisparse
+     element-vorbistag
+     encoder-audio/x-vorbis
+
+   BUT could also be like this (from the faad element in this case):
+
+     decoder-audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int){ 2, 4 }
+
+   NOTE that this does not exactly match the caps string that the installer
+   will get from the application. The application will always ever ask for
+   one of
+
+     decoder-audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)2
+     decoder-audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)4
+
+
+ - when introspecting, keep in mind that there are GStreamer plugins that
+   in turn load external plugins. Examples of these are pitfdll, ladspa, or
+   the GStreamer libvisual plugin. Those plugins will only announce elements
+   for the currently installed external plugins at the time of introspection!
+   With the exception of pitfdll, this is not really relevant to the playback
+   case, but may become an issue in future when applications like buzztard,
+   jokosher or pitivi start requestion elements by name, for example ladspa
+   effect elements or so.
+   
+   This case could be handled if those wrapper plugins would also provide a
+   gst-install-xxx-plugins-helper, where xxx={ladspa|visual|...}. Thus if the
+   distro specific gst-install-plugins-helper can't resolve a request for e.g.
+   element-bml-sonicverb it can forward the request to 
+   gst-install-bml-plugins-helper (bml is the buzz machine loader).

+Stream Status
+-------------
+
+This document describes the design and use cases for the stream status
+messages.
+
+STREAM_STATUS messages are posted on the bus when the state of a streaming
+thread changes. The purpose of this message is to allow the application to
+interact with the streaming thread properties, such as the thread priority or
+the threadpool to use.
+
+We accomodate for the following requirements:
+
+ - Application is informed when a streaming thread is about to be created. It
+   should be possible for the application to suggest a custom GstTask.
+ - Application is informed when the status of a streaming thread is changed.
+   This can be interesting for GUI application that want to visualize the status
+   of the streaming threads (playing/paused/stopped)
+ - Application is informed when a streaming thread is destroyed.
+
+We allow for the following scenarios:
+
+ - Elements require a specific (internal) streaming thread to operate or the
+   application can create/specify a thread for the element.
+ - Elements allow the application to configure a priority on the threads.
+
+
+Use cases
+---------
+
+ * boost the priority of the udp receiver streaming thread
+
+    .--------.    .-------.    .------.    .-------.
+    | udpsrc |    | depay |    | adec |    | asink |
+    |       src->sink    src->sink   src->sink     |
+    '--------'    '-------'    '------'    '-------'
+
+  - when going from READY to PAUSED state, udpsrc will require a streaming
+    thread for pushing data into the depayloader. It will post a STREAM_STATUS
+    message indicating its requirement for a streaming thread.
+
+  - The application will usually react to the STREAM_STATUS messages with a sync
+    bus handler.
+
+  - The application can create and configure a custom GstTask to manage the
+    streaming thread or it can ignore the message which will make the element
+    use its default GstTask.
+
+  - The application can react to the ENTER/LEAVE stream status message to
+    configure the thread right before it is started/stopped. This can be used to
+    configure the thread priority.
+
+  - Before the GstTask is changed state (start/pause/stop) a STREAM_STATUS
+    message is posted that can be used by the application to keep track of
+    the running streaming threads.
+
+
+Messages
+--------
+
+ The existing STREAM_STATUS message will be further defined and implemented in
+ (selected) elements. The following fields will be contained in the message:
+
+  - "type", GST_TYPE_STREAM_STATUS_TYPE
+
+      - a set of types to control the lifecycle of the thread:
+       GST_STREAM_STATUS_TYPE_CREATE: a new streaming thread is going to be
+          created. The application has the chance to configure a custom thread.
+       GST_STREAM_STATUS_TYPE_ENTER: the streaming thread is about to enter its
+          loop function for the first time.
+       GST_STREAM_STATUS_TYPE_LEAVE: the streaming thread is about to leave its
+          loop.
+       GST_STREAM_STATUS_TYPE_DESTROY: a streaming thread is destroyed
+
+      - A set of types to control the state of the threads: 
+       GST_STREAM_STATUS_TYPE_START: a streaming thread is started
+       GST_STREAM_STATUS_TYPE_PAUSE: a streaming thread is paused
+       GST_STREAM_STATUS_TYPE_STOP: a streaming thread is stopped
+
+  - "owner", GST_TYPE_ELEMENT
+      The owner element of the thread. The message source will contain the pad
+      (or one of the pads) that will produce data by this thread. If this thread
+      does not produce data on a pad, the message source will contain the owner
+      as well. The idea is that the application should be able to see from the
+      element/pad what function this thread has in the context of the
+      application and configure the thread appropriatly.
+
+  - "object", G_TYPE, GstTask/GThread
+      A GstTask/GThread controlling this streaming thread. This can be NULL when
+      the object controlling the streaming thread is not yet created.
+
+  - "flow-return", GstFlowReturn
+      A status code for why the thread state changed. when threads are created
+      and started, this is usually GST_FLOW_OK but when they are stopping it
+      contains the reason code why it stopped.
+
+  - "reason", G_TYPE_STRING
+      A string describing the reason why the thread started/stopped/paused.
+      Can be NULL if no reason is given.

+COMPLETELY OUTDATED
+-------------------
+
+
+A little explanation of the first autoplugger in GStreamer:
+
+Autoplugging is implemented in the following places:
+
+ gstpipeline.c : construction of the pipeline
+ gstautoplug.c : selection of the elementfactories needed for autoplugging
+
+1) pipeline setup
+-----------------
+
+before any autoplugging will take place, a new GstPipeline has to be created.
+The autoplugger needs to have a src element and one or more sink elements. the
+autoplugger will try to find the elements needed to connect the src element
+to the sinks.
+
+using:
+
+  gst_pipeline_add_src (GstPipeline *pipeline, GstElement *element);
+
+a source element is added to the pipeline. only one src element can be added
+for now.
+
+using:
+
+  gst_pipeline_add_sink (GstPipeline *pipeline, GstElement *element);
+
+a sink element can be added to the pipeline.
+
+2) starting autoplug
+--------------------
+
+when the pipeline has been set up as above, you will call
+
+  gst_pipeline_autoplug (GstPipeline *pipeline);
+
+to start the autoplugger. this will be done in four phases
+
+ex. we are going to autoplug an mpeg1 system stream.
+
+2a) phase1: figure out the type (GstCaps) of the src element.
+-------------------------------------------------------------
+
+the gsttypefind element is connected to the "src" pad of the source
+element. gst_bin_iterate is called in a loop until gsttypefind
+signals "have_type". the gst_bin_iterate is stopped and the GstCaps
+is retrieved from the gsttypefind element.
+
+gsttypefind is disconnected from the src element and removed from the 
+bin.
+
+the GstCaps of the source element is called src_caps later on.
+
+ex. all typefind functions are tried and the one in mpeg1types will
+     return a GstCaps:
+
+        video/mpeg,
+	"systemstream", GST_PROPS_BOOLEAN (TRUE),
+	"mpegversion",  GST_PROPS_INT (1),
+	NULL
+
+
+2b) phase2: create lists of factories.
+---------------------------------------
+
+for each sink:
+{
+   sinkpad = take the first sinkpad of the sink (HACK)
+   call
+   
+   list[i] = gst_autoplug_caps (src_caps, sinkpad->caps);
+     
+   I++;
+}
+
+gst_autoplug_caps will figure out (based on the padtemplates)
+which elementfactories are needed to connect src_caps to sinkpad->caps
+and will return them in a list.
+
+ex. we have two sinks with following caps:
+
+        video/raw                    audio/raw
+	"...."                       "...."
+
+ gst_autoplug_caps will figure out that for the first sink the following
+ elements are needed:
+
+   mpeg1parse, mp1videoparse, mpeg_play
+
+ for the second sink the following is needed:
+
+   mpeg1parse, mp3parse, mpg123
+
+ We now have two lists of elementfactories.
+
+2c) phase3: collect common elements from the lists.
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+the rationale is that from the lists we have created in phase2, there
+must be some element that is a splitter and that it has to come first (HACK)
+We try to find that element by comparing the lists until an element differs.
+
+we add the common elements to the bin and run gst_pipeline_pads_autoplug. this
+function will loop over the pads of the previous element and the one we
+just added, and tries to connect src to sink if possible. 
+
+If a connection between the two elements could not be made, a signal "new_pad"
+is connected to the element so that pad connection can occur later on when
+the pad is actually created.
+
+ex. when we compare the two lists we see that we have common element: mpeg1parse.
+
+ we add this element to the bin and try to connect it to the previous element in
+ the bin, the disksrc.
+
+ we see that the src pad of the disksrc and the sinkpad of the mpeg1parse element
+ can be connected because they are compatible. We have a pipeline like:
+
+  ---------)         (--------
+   disksrc !         ! mpeg1parse
+           src --- sink
+  ---------)         (--------
+
+
+2d) phase4: add remaining elements
+----------------------------------
+
+now we loop over all the list and try to add the remaining elements
+
+(HACK) we always use a new thread for the elements when there is a common
+element found.
+
+if a new thread is needed (either bacuase the previous element is a common
+element or the object flag of the next element is set to GST_SUGGEST_THREAD)
+we add a queue to the bin and we add a new thread. We add the elements to
+the bin and connect them using gst_pipeline_pads_autoplug.
+
+If we add a queue, we have to copy the caps of the sink element of the queue
+to the src pad of the queue (else they won't connect)
+
+we finally arrive at the sink element and we're done.
+
+ex.
+    
+     we have just found our mpeg1parse common element, so we start a thread.
+     We add a queue to the bin and a new thread, we add the elements
+     mp1videoparse and mpeg_play to the thread. We arrive at the videosink, we
+     see that the SUGGEST_THREAD flag is set, we add a queue and a thread and
+     add the videosink in the thread.
+ 
+     the same procedure happens for the audio part. We are now left with the
+     following pipeline:
+
+     We will also have set a signal "new_pad" on the mpeg1parse element bacause
+     the element mp1videoparse could not be connected to the element just yet.
+

+
+Also any intermedia elements like mixers (subtitles) are not possible because we

+
+1) The Autoplugger API
+----------------------
+
+We'll first describe how to use the autoplugger. We will provide
+a use case: autoplug an mpeg1 system stream for audio/video playback.
+
+
+a) creating an autoplugger
+--------------------------
+
+Before any autoplugging can be done, you'll have to create an 
+autoplugger object. Autoplugger objects (autopluggers) are 
+provided by plugins and are created with gst_autoplugfactor_make().
+
+GStreamer has provisions for two types of autopluggers:
+
+ - regular autopluggers, which act as a complex element construction
+   mechanism. They usually don't create threads and operate solely on
+   GstCaps* for the source and destination. The complex elements 
+   created by regular autopluggers have src and sink pad compatible 
+   with the requested GstCaps*.
+ 
+ - renderer autopluggers, which are designed to create a complex
+   object that can be used to playback media. Renderer autoplugged
+   complex elements have no src pads, only one sink pad.
+
+We'll create a renderer autoplugger like this:
+
+!
+!  GstAutoplug *autoplug;
+!
+!  autoplug = gst_autoplugfactory_make ("staticrender");
+!
+
+
+b) finding out the source media type.
+-------------------------------------
+
+Before we can start the autoplugger, we have to find out the 
+source media type. This can be done using the typefind functions 
+provided by various plugins.
+
+We will create a little pipeline to detect the media type by connecting
+a disksrc element to a typefind element. The typefind element will 
+repeadedly call all registered typefind functions with the buffer it 
+receives on its sink pad. when a typefind function returns a non NULL
+GstCaps*, that caps is set to the sink pad of the typefind element and
+a signal is emitted to notify the app.
+
+Due to caps negotiation, the disksrc will have the detected GstCaps* 
+set on its src pad.
+
+We typically use a function like below to detect the type of a media stream
+on an element (typically a disksrc). The function accepts a pipeline and the
+element inside the pipeline on which the typefind should be performed (passing
+a GstPad* is probably a better option FIXME).
+
+! 
+! static GstCaps*
+! gst_play_typefind (GstBin *bin, GstElement *element)
+! {
+!   GstElement *typefind;
+!   GstCaps *caps = NULL;
+! 
+!   typefind = gst_elementfactory_make ("typefind", "typefind");
+!   g_return_val_if_fail (typefind != NULL, FALSE);
+! 
+!   gst_pad_connect (gst_element_get_pad (element, "src"),
+!                    gst_element_get_pad (typefind, "sink"));
+! 
+!   gst_bin_add (bin, typefind);
+! 
+!   gst_element_set_state (GST_ELEMENT (bin), GST_STATE_PLAYING);
+! 
+!   // push a buffer... the have_type signal handler will set the found flag
+!   gst_bin_iterate (bin);
+! 
+!   gst_element_set_state (GST_ELEMENT (bin), GST_STATE_NULL);
+! 
+!   caps = gst_pad_get_caps (gst_element_get_pad (element, "src"));
+! 
+!   gst_pad_disconnect (gst_element_get_pad (element, "src"),
+!                       gst_element_get_pad (typefind, "sink"));
+!   gst_bin_remove (bin, typefind);
+!   gst_object_unref (GST_OBJECT (typefind));
+! 
+!   return caps;
+! }
+! 
+
+Also note that the disksrc was added to the pipeline before calling this
+typefind function.
+
+When the function returns a non-NULL pointer, the media type has been 
+determined and autoplugging can commence.
+
+Assume that in our mpeg1 use case the above function returns a GstCaps* 
+like:
+
+!
+!  srccaps = GST_CAPS_NEW ("mpeg1system_typefind",
+!                          "video/mpeg",
+!                            "mpegversion",  GST_PROPS_INT (1),
+!                            "systemstream", GST_PROPS_BOOLEAN (TRUE)
+!                         );
+!
+
+
+c) Performing the autoplugging
+------------------------------
+
+Since we use the renderer API, we have to create the output elements
+that are going to be used as the final sink elements.
+
+!
+!  osssink = gst_elementfactory_make("osssink", "play_audio");
+!  videosink = gst_elementfactory_make("xvideosink", "play_video");
+!  
+  
+We then create a complex element using the following code.
+
+!
+!  new_element = gst_autoplug_to_renderers (autoplug,
+!           srccaps,
+!           videosink,
+!           osssink,
+!           NULL);
+!
+!  if (!new_element) {
+!    g_print ("could not autoplug, no suitable codecs found...\n");
+!    exit (-1);
+!  }
+!
+
+2) Autoplugging internals
+-------------------------
+
+We will now describe the internals of the above gst_autoplug_to_renderers()
+function call. This code is implemented in a plugin found in:
+
+    gst/autoplug/gststaticautoplugrender.c
+
+
+
+a) phase1: create lists of factories.
+---------------------------------------
+
+The autoplugger will start with executing the following piece of
+code:
+
+!
+! i = 0;
+!
+! for each sink:
+! {
+!   sinkpad = take the first sinkpad of the sink (HACK)
+!   
+!   list[i] = gst_autoplug_caps (srccaps, sinkpad->caps);
+!     
+!   i++;
+! }
+!
+
+gst_autoplug_caps will figure out (based on the padtemplates)
+which elementfactories are needed to connect srccaps to sinkpad->caps
+and will return them in a list.
+
+The element list is created by using a modified shortest path algorithm
+by Dijkstra (http://www.orie.cornell.edu/~or115/handouts/handout3/handout3.html).
+The nodes of the graph are the elementfactories and the weight of the
+arcs is based on the pad compatibility of the padtemplates of the 
+elementfactory. For incompatible elementfactories, we use a weight of 
+MAX_COST (999999) and for compatible padtemplates we use 1.
+
+ex. we have two sinks with following caps:
+
+!
+!       video/raw                   audio/raw
+!	"...."                       "...."
+!
+
+gst_autoplug_caps will figure out that for the first sink the following
+elements are needed:
+
+!
+!   mpeg1parse, mp1videoparse, mpeg_play
+!
+
+for the second sink the following is needed:
+ 
+!
+!   mpeg1parse, mad
+!
+
+Note that for the audio connection the element list "mpeg1parse, mp3parse,
+mpg123" would also connect the srccaps to the audiosink caps. Since the
+"mpeg1parse, mad" list is shorter, it it always prefered by the autoplugger.
+
+We now have two lists of elementfactories.
+
+
+b) phase2: collect common elements from the lists and add them to a bin.
+------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+The rationale is that from the lists we have created in phase1, there
+must be some element that is a splitter and that it has to come first (HACK)
+We try to find that element by comparing the lists until an element differs.
+
+We start by creating a toplevel bin that is going to be our complex element.
+
+In our use-case we find that mpeg1parse is an element common to both lists,
+so we add it to the bin. We then try to find a good ghostpad for the resulting
+complex element. This is done by looping over the sink pads of the first common
+element and taking the pad that is compatible with the srcaps.
+
+We end up with a bin like this:
+!
+!  (----------------------)
+!  ! autoplug_bin         !
+!  !                      !
+!  !       (------------) !
+!  !       ! mpeg1parse ! !
+!  !   - sink           ! !
+!  !  /    (------------) !
+! sink                    !
+!  (----------------------)
+!
+
+
+c) phase3: add remaining elements
+---------------------------------
+
+now we loop over all the list and try to add the remaining elements
+
+(HACK) we always use a new thread for the elements when there is a common
+element found.
+
+if a new thread is needed (either becuase the previous element is a common
+element or the object flag of the next element is set to GST_SUGGEST_THREAD)
+we add a queue to the bin and we add a new thread. We add the elements to
+the bin and connect them using gst_pipeline_pads_autoplug. 
+
+we finally arrive at the sink element and we're done.
+
+ex.
+    
+     we have just found our mpeg1parse common element, so we start a thread.
+     We add a queue to the bin and a new thread, we add the elements
+     mp1videoparse and mpeg_play to the thread. We arrive at the videosink, we
+     see that the SUGGEST_THREAD flag is set, we add a queue and a thread and
+     add the videosink in the thread.
+ 
+     the same procedure happens for the audio part. We are now left with the
+     following pipeline:
+
+     We will also have set a signal "new_pad" on the mpeg1parse element because
+     the element mp1videoparse could not be connected to the element just yet.
+

+  (---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------)
+
+   The autoplugger will return the autoplug_bin. the app will then connect the 
+   disksrc to the sinkpad of the autoplugged bin.
+
+   Then we play, create_plan happens, data is flowing and the "new_pad" signal is called
+   from mpeg1parse, gst_pipeline_pad_autoplug is called and the connection between
+   mpeg1parse and the videoqueue is made. same for audio.
+
+   Et voila. same procedure for mp3/vorbis/avi/qt/mpeg2 etc...

+- plugindir gets defined for you, don't set it in Makefile.am 
+- plugin_LTLIBRARIES should contain the name of every plugin,

+- put compile/link variables in the following order: CFLAGS, LIBADD, LDFLAGS
+- order _CFLAGS and _LIBADD with the highest in the stack first;

+Optional properties in caps:
+
+During the 0.8 series of GStreamer, we regularly felt the need to add
+properties to caps, thereby sometimes breaking specific caps negotiation
+cases or annoying developers. This document outlines problems it could
+lead to and tries to explain in which cases properties can be added and
+when they can't. It also explains when properties can be optional (both
+temporarily and permanently) and when they cannot.
+
+--
+
+There's two cases where optional properties could be added:
+1) to fix an issue that makes any case fail
+2) to fix an issue that makes some cases fail
+
+Case 1 can be compared to not providing extra_data in caps for WMA. The caps
+are defined, but it will never work because you cannot decode WMA audio
+without the sequence header. In this case, adding the property breaks
+caps compatibility, but it is still allowed because there is no regression
+and it fixes a bug. No optional property should be added here, it should be
+made a required property directly. Another example here is channel-positions
+for channels>2.
+
+Case 2 is more complex. There's various subcases:
+a] not providing this property means ANY (or don't care, or unknown, each
+   of which is another way of saying ANY)
+b] not providing this property means a specific value
+ .] adding this property will lead to unwanted behaviour
+ .] adding this property will not lead to unwanted behaviour
+
+An example case for 2a is the buffer-frames property in float audio or the
+frames property in MPEG audio. Buffer-frames is 0 (which should be removed)
+means ANY. The reason that it should not be zero is because connecting an
+element with buffer-frames=SOME_VALUE should be allowed to connect to any
+element out there that has no buffer-frames requirement. The opposite is
+true reversely: an element with no buffer-frames property should never be
+allowed to connect to any element requesting a specific buffer-frames value.
+For MPEG audio, it is TRUE likewise. Mathematically, buffer-frames=0 does not
+exist. It implies ANY. Similarly, framed=FALSE cannot exist, because it
+implies framed={FALSE,TRUE} (in words: an element cannot require non-framed
+MPEG audio, because framed MPEG audio is a subset of non-framed MPEG audio
+and thus valid input). In all those cases for 2a, optional properties are
+fine. Subtraction will not work, but as explained, values are subsets of
+another value and thus subtraction is irrelevant (because the mathematical
+value of the subtraction has no real value).
+This same principle is true for rate/channels on (for example) MPEG audio.
+Our caps negotiation already allows for all of this, and optional properties
+are already being used for this.
+
+2b is complex, since subtraction actually has a value here, and addition
+of such properties may lead to regressions or crashes. Let's give another
+two examples: stride (for raw video; not providing this value implies 4-byte
+aligned video) and pixel-aspect-ratio (default value being 1/1). Adding p-a-r
+was in this case an example of 2bII, whereas stride is 2bI. The reason for
+this is simple: adding pixel-aspect-ratio to some element and not to others
+could lead to misunderstanding size. However, this is not a regression,
+because not adding it alltogether would lead to the same misunderstanding.
+In both cases, the result would be wrongly sized video. Therefore, there
+is no regression and there is a bugfix, so this is fine. Obviously, the
+optional property is in this case very specifically a temporary solution.
+As soon as we can, this property should become obligatory.
+Stride is different, because elements have implicit associated behaviour
+based on the previous beahviour. This hebaviour could break if some elements
+do implement stride and others still don't. Therefore, adding an optional
+property as a temporary hack is, in this case, not a good idea and should
+be disallowed. A proper fix should be done in the same timeframe as 2bII. In
+this case, optional properties should not be added. Another example of this
+case was adding channel-positions to audio caps with channels=1,2, which
+was rejected for the same reason: it would break a perfectly-working set
+of rules in a stable series.
+
+--
+
+Obviously, with all of the above, people will start fighting about which
+group their specific properties change belongs to. General consensus is

+Stream selection
+=
+
+1. Problem
+URIs (that being either a media stream or a media stream plus subtitle) can
+contain multiple streams of a type (audio, subtitle). A user has to be given
+the option of selecting one of those streams (or none alltogether).
+
+2. Implementation ideas
+Stream selection, in GStreamer, has to be integrated at the player plugging
+level, which is (in the case of Totem) playbin. Playbin offers a feature to
+'mute' a stream (which means that no processing is done on that stream
+alltogether, saving the decoding step). Currently, playbin will select the
+first occurrence of a stream type and mute all others. A queue is connected
+(for pre-roll) to the active stream. What is missing here is a way to change
+the active stream.
+Playbin interface - one possible interface could simply consist of a bunch of
+GObject properties: 'textstream' and 'audiostream', both integer. The number
+of available streams can be retrieved using the 'stream-info' GObject property.
+Similar to the 'nstreams' property, we could add utility GObject properties
+for getting the number of available audio/text streams ('naudiostreams' and
+'ntextstreams'). Names of these streams (like language name or so) can be
+added as an additional GObject property to streaminfo. Some container
+formats contain such names internally. Alternatively, we could allow those
+to be user-settable as well (for .sub files).
+On a set of either of these properties, playbasebin would mute the old
+selected stream (if any), unmute the newly selected stream (if any) and
+replug the preroll queue. The queue itself is disabled as well if no new
+stream was linked. Alternatively, a switch-like element is used, which
+requires no replugging. Pad disabling/enabling is then enough. This also
+makes relinking less painful. The switch-like element needs to proxy the
+active pads' caps. However, since those caps are (in practice) always the
+same accross streams, caps setting will (inside the core) immediately
+return success.
+The switch-like element simply works like this:
+=
+static void
+loop_func (GstElement * element)
+{
+  GList *inpads;
+  GstPad *pad;
+  GstData *data;
+
+  for (inpads = ..; inpads != NULL; inpads = inpads->next) {
+    pad = inpads->data;
+    if (!GST_PAD_IS_USABLE (pad))
+      continue;
+
+    /* you'd also want some way to synchronize the inputs... */
+    data = gst_pad_pull (pad);
+    if (is_active_pad (pad))
+      gst_pad_push (srcpad, data);
+    else
+      gst_data_unref (data);
+  }
+}
+=
+It'd require an active-stream property itself, which (when set) takes
+care of doing renegotiation and so on. Using internal pad linkage is
+extremely useful here, and requires little code in the switch-like
+element itself. Note that there is a slight bit of duplication in the
+playbin interface and the switch-like element interface, but that's "just
+the way it is".
+The implemention of the switch-like element could initially be local to
+playbin, until it has been cleaned up and confirmed to be useful to a
+wider audience. This allows a lot of experimenting with interfaces because
+we won't be forced to maintain a stable interface.
+The current 'switch' element (gst-plugins/gst/switch/) already does a few
+of those operations, but stream synchronization, re-negotiation on stream
+changes, internal pad linkage and some other things are completely missing.
+If we're gonna use this element, it'll need a large overhaul. The choice of
+writing a new element or using an existing element as basis, and also the
+choice of whether or not to make this element local to playbin, should be
+based on technical merits and cost/effect analysis and not on personal
+pride.
+
+Notes:
+* seamless has the same switch-like element, but it's chain-based. Apart
+from scheduler considerations, this is a good idea, but limits its use
+(making either good docs and abuse-prevention [see multifilesrc] or
+private-to-playbin a prerequisite).
+* maybe text-* properties need to be renamed to subtitle-*.

+Subtitles
+=========
+
+1. Problem
+GStreamer currently does not support subtitles.
+
+2. Proposed solution
+  - Elements
+  - Text-overlay
+  - Autoplugging
+  - Scheduling
+  - Stream selection
+
+The first thing we'll need is subtitle awareness. I'll focus on AVI/MKV/OGM
+here, because I know how that works. The same methods apply to DVD subtitles
+as well. The matroska demuxer (and Ogg) will need subtitle awareness. For
+AVI, this is not needed. Secondly, we'll need subtitle stream parsers (for
+all popular subtitle formats), that can deal both with parsed streams (MKV,
+OGM) as well as .sub file chunks (AVI). Sample code is available in
+gst-sandbox/textoverlay/.
+
+Secondly, we'll need a textoverlay filter that can take text and video and
+blits text on video. We have several such elements (e.g. the cairo-based
+element) in gst-plugins already. Those might need some updates to work
+exactly as expected.
+
+Thirdly, playbin will need to handle all that. We expect subtitle streams
+to end up as subimages or plain text (or xhtml text). Note that playbin
+should also allow access to the unblitted subtitle as text (if available)
+for accessibility purposes.
+
+A problem popping up is that subtitles are no continuous streams. This is
+especially noticeable in the MKV/OGM case, because there the input of data
+depends on the other streams, so we'll only notice delays inside an element
+when we've received the next data chunk. There are two possible solutions:
+using timestamped filler events or using decoupled subtitle overlay elements
+(bins, probably). The first has as a difficulty that it only works well in
+the AVI/.sub case, where we will notice discontinuities before they become
+problematic. The second is more difficult to implement, but works for both
+cases.
+A) fillers
+Imagine that two subtitles come after each other, with 10 seconds of no-data
+in between. By parsing a .sub file, we would notice immediately and we could
+send a filler event (or empty data) with a timestamp and duration in between.
+B) decoupled
+Imagine this text element:
+------------------------------
+video ----- | actual element |out
+|        /  -----------------|
+text - -                     |
+------------------------------
+where the text pad is decoupled, like a queue. When no text data is available,
+the pad will have received no data, and the element will render no subtitles.
+The actual element can be a bin here, containing another subtitle rendering
+element. Disadvantage: it requires threading, and the element itself is (in
+concept) kinda gross. The element can be embedded in playbin to hide this
+fact (i.e. not be available outside the scope of playbin).
+Whichever solution we take, it'll require effort from the implementer.
+Scheduling (process, not implementation) knowledge is assumed.
+
+Stream selection is a problem that audio has, too. We'll need a solution for
+this at the playback bin level, e.g. playbin. By muting all unused streams
+and dynamically unmuting the selected stream, this is easily solved. Note
+that synchronization needs to be checked in this case. The solution is not
+hard, but someone has to do it.

+<BBB> I don't think it's good to make that variable
+<Company> dunno
+<Company> (i'm btw always looking at this from the midi perspective, too)
+<Company> (because both subtitles and midi are basically the same in this regard)
+<BBB> and do you mean 'after the stream has advanced <time> and we didn't read a new subtitle in this mkv stream, we should send a filler'?
+<Company> yeah
+<BBB> it goes for avi with large init_delay values, too
+<Company> so you don't need to send fillers every frame
+<BBB> right
+<BBB> cant' we just set that to, for example, 1s?
+<BBB> it's fairly random, but still
+<Company> that's another option, too
+<Company> though you could write all file parsers with max-delay=MAXINT
+<Company> would make them a lot easier
+<BBB> it's true that queue size, for example, depends on this value
+<BBB> e.g. if you make this 5s and set queue size to 1s, it'll hang
+<Company> right
+<BBB> whereas if you set it to 1s and queue size to 5s, you waste space
+<BBB> :)
+<BBB> you ought to set it to max-delay * (n_streams + 1)
+<BBB> or so
+<BBB> or -1
+<BBB> I forgot
+<BBB> ohwell
+<Company> if you'd use filtercaps and queue sizes in your app, you could at least work around deadlocks
+<BBB> yeah
+<Company> though ideally it should just work of course...

+METADATA ON BUFFERS IS OUTDATED
+-------------------------------
+
+
+Buffer mutability properties are the most important part of gst, and
+similarly are the most complex.
+
+The simple case is that a buffer is created, memory allocated, data put
+in it, and passed to the next filter.  That filter reads the data, does
+something (like creating a new buffer and decoding into it), and
+unreferences the buffer.  This causes the data to be freed and the buffer
+to be destroyed.
+
+A more complex case is when the filter modifies the data in place.  It
+does so and simply passes on the buffer to the next element.  This is just
+as easy to deal with.
+
+If the second filter adds metadata to the buffer, it just has to add the
+pointer to the list.  The next element simply traverses the list and

+SOME OF THE FIRST IDEAS, PRETTY OUTDATED
+----------------------------------------
+
+
+During the course of a discussion on IRC, it turned out
+that there are many possible ways to handle the capabilities.
+
+A capability is basically a set of properties attached to a 
+mimetype in order to more closely describe the mimetype. 
+Capabilities are supposed to be attached to pads so that the
+autoplugging algorithm has more specific information to connect
+compatible pads.
+
+We present 3 possible implementation for the capabilities. we need
+to pick one of them.
+
+1. static capabilities
+----------------------
+
+When an element is created, it creates its pads like:
+
+  mpg123->sinkpad = gst_pad_new ("sink", GST_PAD_SINK);
+  gst_element_add_pad (GST_ELEMENT (mpg123), mpg123->sinkpad);
+
+  mpg123->srcpad = gst_pad_new ("src", GST_PAD_SRC);
+  gst_element_add_pad (GST_ELEMENT (mpg123), mpg123->srcpad);
+
+In the static capabilities case, it will attach a GstCaps* structure
+to the pad. The GstCaps structure in the above example might look like:
+
+  static GstCapsFactory mpg123_sink_caps = {
+    "audio/mp3",
+    "layer",   GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (1, 3),
+    "bitrate", GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (8, 320),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+with 
+
+mpg123sinkcaps  = gst_caps_register (mpg123_sink_caps);
+
+the factory can be converted into a GstCaps* structure. The
+GstCaps* structure is attached to the pad with:
+
+gst_pad_add_caps (mpg123->sinkpad, mpg123sinkcaps);
+
+The GstElement would then have a sinkpad with the given 
+mimetype (audio/mp3) and with the capabilitities of accepting
+mpeg layer 1 to 3 and a bitrate from 8 up to 320 Kbps.
+
+Likewise, the src pad could be set up in the same way. An
+example capability factory could look like:
+
+  static GstCapsFactory mpg123_src_caps = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "format",   GST_CAPS_BITFIELD (...),
+    "depth",    GST_CAPS_INT (16),
+    "rate",     GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (4000, 96000),
+    "channels", GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (1, 2),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+All GstElements would present their pads with the appropriate
+capabilities structure.
+
+The autoplugger would then proceed (once the source media type
+is known with a typefind function) in finding all the elements
+with compatible pads and connecting them into a pipeline. 
+
+All elements of the complete pipeline could then be constructed
+with one single pass. No new elements should be added to the
+pipeline because we can figure out all the possibilities using the
+pad capabilities.
+
+We call this the static case because the capabilities of the pads
+are supposed to stay the same after creating the element.
+
+While the ability to completly setup the pipeline before actually 
+starting playback is an advantage regarding performance, one obvious
+problem with this setup is that the static case may be too static in
+some cases. We can illustrate this with the following setup:
+
+  ----------)             (------------
+   mpg123   !             !  audiosink
+           src          sink
+            !             !
+  ----------)             (------------
+
+The mpg123 element has its src capabilities set up as mpg123_src_caps
+in the above example.
+
+The audio renderer has its capabilities set up with the following
+factory:
+
+  static GstCapsFactory audio_sink_caps = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "format",   GST_CAPS_BITFIELD (...),
+    "depth",    GST_CAPS_INT (16),
+    "rate",     GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (22000, 44000),
+    "channels", GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (1, 2),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+The static autoplugger has to be carefull when connecting the mpg123
+element with the audiosink because it is theoretically possible that
+the mpg123 element outputs raw audio with a rate that cannot be
+handled by the audiosink (ex. 4000KHz). In the absense of another
+audiosink with more capabilities, the autoplugging of this simple 
+pipeline will not be possible and would fail.
+
+the autoplugging algorithm would probably select another element to
+insert between the mpg123 element and the audiosink in order to handle
+the (uncommon) case of a rate conversion (audioscaler).
+
+It is clear that this static setup might even fail or work suboptimal
+for even the common case and should therefore be considered as too 
+restrictive.
+
+
+2. dynamic capabilities
+-----------------------
+
+The idea of dynamic capabilities is that the capabilities are not set
+at element create time but rather while the pipeline is running.
+
+An element would still list its mime type using: 
+
+  gst_pad_add_type_id(mpg123->sinkpad, mp3type);
+
+The idea would then be that a rough draft of the pipeline would be
+built afer the media type of the stream has been detected with the
+typefind functions. The rough draft would consist of laying out a
+global plan to reach the renderer(s). this plan would basically list
+the set of conversions that have to be performed. (mime-type to
+mime-type conversion).
+
+Elements that accept the src mime-type are tried by giving it a buffer.
+If the element accepts the buffer, it will set its capabilities for
+both the sink pad and the src pad. At that time other elements can be
+tried and added to the src pad, until we reach the renderer. As usual
+one has to be carefull to add just the minimum amount of elements to
+reach the renderer. The global plan will help with that.
+
+Since we basically do not use the capabilities of the sink pad one has 
+to question the need for sink pad capabilities in the first place.
+
+We might also have a hard time trying different elements until we find
+a compatible one that does not cause a dead end at some point.
+
+
+3. combined setup
+-----------------
+
+This combined setup will minimise the effort needed to try different 
+elements encountered by option 2 while still allowing a more dynamic
+setup based on the actual media stream we are handling.
+
+The combined setup will list/add the sink capabilities at create time.
+It will only set the mime-type of its src pads.
+
+As with option2, a global plan will be built. At runtime the src pads
+will actually specify the capabilities they need for any element that
+wants to be connected to its source pads.
+
+In this case we specifiy the capabilities for all the sink pads of an
+element at create time. The capabilities of the src pads would only
+become available when data has been processed by the element.
+
+The autoplugger would then be able to choose an element that can handle
+the capability listed by the src pad.
+
+in our previous example:
+
+  ----------)             (------------
+   mpg123   !             !  audiosink
+           src          sink
+            !             !
+  ----------)             (------------
+				 
+the audiosink element would specify its sink pad capabilities at create
+time, while the mpg123 elements src pad would not yet have any capabilities
+set.
+
+When data is handled by the mpg123 element, a capability would be added to
+the mpg123 src pad. This capability might be:
+
+  static GstCapsFactory mpg123_src_caps = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "format",   GST_CAPS_INT (S16),
+    "depth",    GST_CAPS_INT (16),
+    "rate",     GST_CAPS_INT (44000),
+    "channels", GST_CAPS_INT (2),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+This capability would be compatible with the audiosinks sinkpad capabilities
+and the autoplugger would therefore be able to connect the two elements.
+
+While allowing a more flexible setup with option3, compared to option1, we 
+introduce a slightly higher overhead when we need to dynamically connect 
+elements. This overhead will not be as big as option2 because we don't 
+have to 'try' elements.
+
+so:
+
+  src caps:  added at runtime to list the caps needed for an element that
+             wants to connect to this pad.
+  sink caps: the (static) capabilities that this sinkpad has.

+
+
+IMPLEMENTATION
+
+Pad Capabilities (caps) are mathematical sets that represent all the
+possible stream types that a pad can use.  These general sets are
+represented by unions of simpler sets known as caps structures.  Each
+caps structure has a media type (e.g., "audio/mpeg") and a number of
+properties.  Each property has a name and a GValue.  In normal
+circumstances, the GValue will have the types int, boolean, string,
+fourcc, and double.  Simple sets are constructed by using GValues
+that are lists of other GValues, or the special types that represent
+int ranges and double ranges.
+
+A "fixed" caps represents exactly one media format.  This means that
+the caps is a union of exactly one caps structure, and each property
+in the caps structure is a simple type, i.e., no ranges or lists.
+
+There are two special caps values, "ANY" which represents the union
+of all stream types, and "EMPTY", which represents the set of no
+stream types.  The ANY caps is often used on generic elements that
+handle any type of data (e.g., filesrc and filesink).  The EMPTY
+caps is the return value of gst_caps_intersect(), when the two
+given caps do not intersect.  In many cases, using EMPTY is invalid.
+
+
+CAPS NEGOTIATION
+
+Elements provide information to the core about what stream formats
+they understand in four ways: the caps in the pad templates, the
+caps returned by a pad's getcaps function, accepting/denying
+a given caps in the pad link function, and a new fixate function.
+
+The pad template caps should be the union of caps a pad supports
+in any potential situation.  Simultaneously, these caps should be
+as specific as possible, since it is used to decide which elements
+to attempt for autoplugging, without having to load the element.
+The pad template caps are generally detemined at compile time, but
+might be actually computed at run-time from other information.
+
+The getcaps() function returns the caps supported by a given pad,
+in the context of the element's state, its link to other elements,
+and the devices or files it has opened.  These caps must be a
+subset of the pad template caps.  In the NULL state with no links,
+the getcaps function should ideally return the same caps as the
+pad template.  In rare circumstances, an object property can affect
+the caps returned by getcaps, but this is discouraged.  For most
+filters, the caps returned by getcaps is directly affected by the
+allowed caps on other pads.  For demuxers and decoders, the caps
+returned by the srcpad's getcaps function is directly related to
+the stream data.  Again, getcaps should return the most specific
+caps it reasonably can, since this helps with autoplugging.
+
+The pad link function is the last step in negotiating caps.  The
+core calls the pad link function with a fixed caps, meaning that
+the stream format is precisely defined, with the caps having one
+structure, with no fields that are ranges or lists.
+
+There is also a new pad function "fixate", which is used to help
+choose a fixed caps from a non-fixed caps.  This is called in
+situations where normal negotiation cannot decide on a fixed caps.
+You should almost never implement a fixate function, please ask
+me if it is appropriate for your case.  Fixate functions are called
+iteratively on the pads until a fixed caps is found.  Fixate functions
+are called with a const caps, and should return a caps that is a
+strict subset of the given caps.  That is, the function should
+create a caps that is "more fixed" than previously, but does not
+have to return fixed caps.  If the fixate function can't provide
+more fixed caps, it should return NULL.
+
+
+
+Checklist for getcaps:
+
+ - The getcaps function prototype no longer has the caps parameter.
+   Remove it.
+
+ - The returned caps is owned by the caller.  Make sure you don't
+   keep a pointer to the caps.
+ 
+ - Make sure that the getcaps function can be called safely in each
+   element state (NULL, READY, PAUSED, PLAYING), and for any element
+   configuration (properties, links, devices/files opened or not,
+   error state, etc.)
+
+ - Make sure that the returned caps do not depend on the caps that
+   indicate the stream type that the pad is currently using.
+
+Checklist for pad_link:
+
+ - The pad link function prototypes uses a const GstCaps *.
+
+ - Pad link functions are called with fixed caps.  There's no need
+   to check for this.  This means that you can assume that the caps
+   is not ANY or EMPTY, and that there is exactly one structure in
+   the caps, and that all the fields in the structure are fixed.
+
+ - Pad link functions are called with caps that are a subset of the
+   most recent return value of the pad's getcaps function.  Generally,
+   the getcaps function was called immediately prior to calling the
+   src_link function.  For 0.8, you can assume that nothing has changed
+   in your element that would cause a change to the return value of
+   getcaps.
+
+ - the return value GST_PAD_LINK_OK should be used when the caps are
+   acceptable, and you've extracted all the necessary information from
+   the caps and set the element's internal state appropriately.
+
+ - the return value GST_PAD_LINK_REFUSED should be used when the caps
+   are unacceptable for whatever reason.
+
+ - the return value GST_PAD_LINK_DELAYED should be used when the
+   element is in a state where it can't determine whether the caps
+   are acceptable or not.  This is often used if the element needs
+   to open a device or process data before determining acceptable
+   caps.
+
+ - the pad_link function must not call gst_caps_try_set_caps() on
+   the pad that was specified as a parameter.
+
+ - the pad_link function may (and often should) call
+   gst_caps_try_set_caps() on pads that are not specified as the
+   pad parameter.
+ 
+Checklist for fixate:
+
+ - Make sure you actually should be using a fixate function.  Fixate
+   functions are reasonable for non-fixed primary sources, such as
+   videotestsrc, v4lsrc, and osssrc.
+
+ - The user_data parameter is mainly used for user-provided fixate
+   function.  It should be ignored in element fixate functions.

+	* gst/gstbin.c (gst_bin_set_element_sched)

+	mutexes are not properly unlocked.

+	(group_dec_link), (gst_opt_scheduler_pad_link),
+	(group_inc_links_for_element), (group_migrate_connected):
+	Call group_inc_link with the proper src->sink ordering -- 
+	break this, and we break sort_chain. patch from wingo for bug
+	147713.
+	Partially revert patch 1.89. When adding a loop based element to 
+	the scheduler, the links to other groups are automatically followed
+	and incremented. This should not happen because the bin will call
+	pad_link explicitly for those connection, resulting in them counted 
+	twice. Results in assertion failure on pipeline cleanup.

+	(gst_pad_link_call_link_functions): Since this function is the

+	  Since this effectively disallows linking elements before putting
+	  them in a bin, some applications might not work after this and error
+	  out. If these applications are too critical, we might need to revert
+	  that patch. Please test this before the next release...

+          spilled over to the user registry.  Note that in the case of using

+          beyond the one given by this var, and thus we don't set a user
+          registry to spill to.  So make sure GST_REGISTRY is writable.

+	for reverting.
+
+2004-02-24  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>
+
+	* gst/gstelement.c (gst_element_dispose): Protect against multiple
+	invocations.
+
+	* gst/schedulers/gstoptimalscheduler.c:
+	I added a mess of prototypes at the top of the file by way of
+	documentation. Some of the operations on chains and groups were
+	re-organized.
+
+	(create_group): Added a type argument so if the group is enabled,
+	the setup_group_scheduler knows what to do.
+	(group_elements): Added a type argument here, too, to be passed on
+	to create_group.
+	(group_element_set_enabled): If an unlinked PLAYING element is
+	added to a bin, we have to create a new group to hold the element,
+	and this function will be called before the group is added to the
+	chain. Thus we have a valid case for group->chain==NULL. Instead
+	of calling chain_group_set_enabled, just set the flag on the group
+	(the chain's status will be set when the group is added to it).
+	(gst_opt_scheduler_state_transition, chain_group_set_enabled):
+	Setup the group scheduler when the group is enabled, not
+	specifically when an element goes PAUSED->PLAYING. This means
+	PLAYING elements can be added, linked, and scheduled into a
+	PLAYING pipeline, as was intended.
+	(add_to_group): Don't ref the group twice. I don't know when this
+	double-ref got in here. Removing it has the potential to cause
+	segfaults if other parts of the scheduler are buggy. If you find
+	that the scheduler is segfaulting for you, put in an extra ref
+	here and see if that hacks over the underlying issue. Of course,
+	then find out what code is unreffing a group it doesn't own...
+	(create_group): Make the extra refcount floating, and remove it
+	after adding the element. This means that...
+	(unref_group): Destroy when the refcount reaches 0, not 1, like
+	every other refcounted object in the known universe.
+	(remove_from_group): When a group becomes empty, set it to be not
+	active, and remove it from its chain. Don't unref it again,
+	there's no floating reference any more.
+	(destroy_group): We have to remove the group from the chain in
+	remove_from_group (rather than here) to break refcounting cycles
+	(the chain always has a ref on the group). So assert that
+	group->chain==NULL.
+	(ref_group_by_count): Removed, it was commented out anyway.
+	(merge_chains): Use the remove_from_chain and add_to_chain
+	primitives to do the reparenting, instead of rolling our own
+	implementation.
+	(add_to_chain): The first non-disabled group in the chain's group
+	list will be the entry point for the chain. Because buffers can
+	accumulate in loop elements' peer bufpens, we preferentially
+	schedule loop groups before get groups to avoid unnecessary
+	execution of get-based groups when the bufpens are already full.
+	(gst_opt_scheduler_schedule_run_queue): Debug fixes.
+	(get_group_schedule_function): Ditto.
+	(loop_group_schedule_function): Ditto.
+	(gst_opt_scheduler_loop_wrapper): Ditto.
+	(gst_opt_scheduler_iterate): Ditto.
+
+	I understand the opt scheduler now, yippee!

+	(gst_pad_convert, gst_pad_query_default, gst_pad_query) 
+	(gst_pad_get_formats_default, gst_pad_get_formats): Better
+	argument checks, and some doc fixes.
+
+	(gst_pad_custom_new_from_template): Um, does anyone
+	use these functions? Actually make a custom pad instead of a
+	normal one.
+	(gst_pad_try_set_caps): Transpose some checks.
+	(gst_pad_try_set_caps_nonfixed): Same, and use a macro to check if
+	the pad is in negotiation.
+	(gst_pad_try_relink_filtered): Use pad_link_prepare.

+2004-01-02  David Schleef  <ds@schleef.org>
+

+	OK without renegotiating.  caps-nego-failed signal fixed so that
+	the marshaller isn't VOID__OBJECT.  Also changed to G_TYPE_POINTER

+
+2003-12-23  David Schleef  <ds@schleef.org>
+
+	* gst/gstpad.c:
+	  Rearrange/rewrite much of the pad negotiation code, since it

+	  depending on how it was invoked.  Add (internal) structure
+	  GstPadLink, which is used to hold some information (more in
+	  the future) about the link between two pads.  Fixes a number
+	  of bugs, including random lossage of filter caps when the
+	  initial negotiation is delayed.  A few functions are still
+	  unimplemented.
+	* gst/gstpad.h:
+	  Add GST_PAD_LINK_{SUCESSFUL|FAILED}() macros.  Please use
+	  these when testing GstPadLinkReturn values instead of comparing

+TIME
+In this document, the word "time" is not meant to represent a representation of
+time that is close to reality. Though that is the idea in most cases, it is not
+the focus. Time in this document is meant to represent time inside a stream that
+is played back by GStreamer. There might be reasons to represent time in non-
+realtime, for example when the processor is too slow to allow for video playback
+in realtime, the clock might not update fast enough. Or one might want to use
+a clock that purposefully increases/reduces the speed of time.
+Time in this document is not meant to be linear either. Whereas elements can set
+time freely by seeking, clocks should do their best to supply linear time. It is
+not a requirement however, there might for example be slight inconsistencies 
+when audio clocks have buffer over/underruns.
+
+TIME IN A CLOCK
+The job of a clock is to report the time as exactly as possible that has elapsed
+in the stream since the stream was started.
+A Clock does never seek, so if someone seeks the stream back to the beginning, 
+the clock will still represent the time since a start.
+The state of the clock is managed by all elements using its time as a state of a
+bin is changed according to its children. A clock will try to synchronize its 
+state with its provider. (FIXME: or with all its children like a bin? FIXME: 
+What to do in the case of a providerless clock like _a_ systemclock (we might 
+use multiple systemclocks)? Attach to one element that uses it and reattach if 
+element is removed? FIXME: What do we do when a provider is removed from a 
+scheduler? Sounds like a good time to get a new clock to take over. FIXME: 
+Write a test that does exactly this in Gst-Player when changing the GConf Key.)
+- NULL / READY
+  Nobody cares about time reported by the clock.
+- PLAYING
+  Clock is supposed to present the time elapsed since it was started.
+- PAUSED
+  The clock has to remember the time it was stopped and resume with that time
+  when it restarts playing.
+
+TIME IN AN ELEMENT
+An element only can request time information if it uses a clock. The element can
+query functions that give information about the elements time. Time information
+for the element is always in relation to the timestamps the element expects on 
+its buffers.
+Example: XVideosink will output a new frame, when xvideosinks time matches the 
+         timestamps of the buffer.
+The elements time is in no relation to the time of its clock because of seeks.
+If an element seeks, it adjusts its time by the difference the seek has
+introduced.
+Example: Playback of a song with duration 1000 that is looping. Clock and 
+         element start at time offset 0, when the element is first set to 
+         PLAYING. After the first loop, the elements time is (by request of that
+         element) reset to 0. The clock's time stays at 1000.
+Note: If an element goes into the PAUSED state the elements time will continue
+      running. (FIXME: possibility to change that needed? Why would you want to
+      pause an element that should be synced while the others continue running?
+      FIXME: What happens if a clock provider and therefore the clock are 
+      already at EOS while other elements are still playing? I'd vote for make
+      all other elements go as fast as possible. FIXME: Ask some video people if
+      that sounds reasonable or if we gotta force the clock to go on, which
+      would make it difficult to detect the difference between EOS and pause.
+      
+PROVIDERS
+Providers are elements that can provide timing information and therefore provide
+a clock to other elements. These elements have to update the clock, when it is
+used. When a clock is used (state != NULL - FIXME: or other states?), the 
+provider is guaranteed to use this clock. (FIXME: necessary?). The element is
+however required to synchronize to the clock it was assigned to, wether it is
+its own clock or not.
+
+SYNC POINTS
+FIXME: Is it necessary to have sync points? This would allow to supply a fixed
+time between sync point "SOURCE" and "SINK" so one could buffer the time
+inbetween. Or is there another solution for this problem? It's possibly easier
+to use an element that does TIMESTAMP = TIMESTAMP - x inside the pipeline and 
+drops every buffer before.
+
+FUNCTIONS
+FIXME: Use GstTime(Diff) instead of GstClockTime(Diff) ?
+
+GstClockTime	gst_clock_get_time	(GstClock *clock);
+GstElementState	gst_clock_get_state 	(GstClock *clock); /* setting works internally */
+GstClockReturn	gst_clock_wait		(GstClock *clock, GstClockTime until, GstClockTimeDiff *jitter);
+
+GST_FLAG	GST_ELEMENT_NEEDS_CLOCK; /* wether we want a clock or not */
+GstClockTime	gst_element_get_time	(GstElement *element);
+void		gst_element_(clock_)seek (GstElement *element, GstClockTimeDiff diff);
+GstClock *	gst_element_get_clock	(GstElement *element);
+GstClockReturn	gst_element_(clock_)wait (GstElement *element, GstClockTime until, GstClockTimeDiff *jitter);
+
+possible extensions:
+GstClockTime	gst_clock_get_resolution (GstClock *clock); /* sounds interesting */
+void		gst_clock_wait_async	(GstClock *clock, GFunc callback, gpointer data); /* useless IMO */
+void		gst_clock_unlock	(GstClock *clock); /* dunno what for */
+void		gst_clock_set_state	(GstClock *clock, GstElementState state); /* might be needed, but screw up alot */
+
+Hm, this looks to easy when you only need an API of 8 functions. But it's quite
+a bit of internal hacking because of the state changes.

+STATUS: GstData is not implemented as a class for speed reasons.
+----------------------------------------------------------------
+
+NB: This document does not represent the current state of CVS but my current plans on how to implement this.
+
+Basics
+======
+
+Hierarchy
+---------
+GstData
+  GstInstream
+    GstBuffer
+    GstEventNewMedia
+    GstEventDiscontinuous
+    GstEventEOS
+    GstEventLength
+  GstOutOfStream
+    GstEventLock
+    GstEventUnLock
+    GstEventSeek
+    GstEventFlush
+    GstEventEmpty
+
+
+GstData
+=======
+
+typedef GstData * (*GstDataCopyFunction) (GstData *data);
+typedef void (*GstDataFreeFunction) (GstData *data);
+
+struct _GstData
+{
+  /* is a */
+  GstDataClass *	klass;
+  
+  /* refcounting */
+#ifdef HAVE_ATOMIC_H
+  atomic_t 		refcount;
+#else
+  gint 			refcount;
+  GMutex *		reflock;
+#endif
+  
+  /* flags */
+  guint			flags;
+};
+
+struct _GstDataClass
+{
+  GstDataType		type;
+
+  GstDataCopyFunction	copy;
+  GstDataFreeFunction	free;
+};
+
+Inheritance
+-----------
+A GstData descandant GstMyData, would look like this:
+struct _GstMyData {
+  GstData parent;
+  /* more stuff specific to GstMyData */
+}
+
+You can even enhance the class struct, if you want to. This works just like inheritance in GLib.
+
+If it can be a parent class, it should implement these three functions publically:
+void gst_my_data_init (GstMyData *data) {
+  /* call the parent's init function, eg: */
+  gst_data_init (GST_DATA (data));
+  /* initialize your data now */
+}
+void gst_my_data_dispose (GstMyData *data) {
+  /* free every data, that needs to be freed */
+  /* call the parent's dispose function, eg: */
+  gst_data_dispose (GST_DATA (data));
+  /* do NOT free the data */
+}
+GstData *gst_my_data_do_copy (GstMyData *to, GstMyData *from) {
+  /* call the parent's copy function, eg: */
+  gst_data_do_copy (GST_DATA (to), GST_DATA (from));
+  /* copy relevant stuff from your struct now */
+  /* note: the copy function must return a writable object, you may not set GST_DATA_READONLY here */
+}
+
+If GstMyData should be instantiable, you should do this:
+Get a class struct, something like this:
+static GstDataClass my_data_class = { GST_TYPE_MY_DATA,
+      gst_my_data_copy_func,
+      gst_my_data_free_func };
+FIXME: At the moment all types need to be specified in a big enum in gstdata.h.
+       We might want to change that when we support event plugins.
+The two functions above should look something like this:
+GstData *gst_my_data_copy_func (GstData *from) {
+  /* allocate memory */
+  GstMyData *copy = g_new (GstMyData, 1);
+  /* copy relevant variables or initialize them */
+  gst_my_data_copy (copy, GST_MY_DATA (from));
+  
+  return copy;
+}
+void gst_my_data_free_func (GstData *data) {
+  /* first dispose all data */
+  gst_my_data_dispose (GST_MY_DATA (data));
+  /* now free the struct */
+  g_free (data);
+}
+      
+Now you just need a function that can be called from the real world:
+GstMyData *gst_my_data_new (void) {
+  /* allocate memory */
+  GstMyData *my_data = g_new (GstMyData, 1);
+  /* initialize the variables */
+  gst_my_data_init (my_data);
+  /* set the right type */
+  GST_DATA (my_data)->type = &my_data_class;
+  
+  return my_data;
+}
+
+summary of inheritance:
+- define structs like GObject inheritance
+- inheritance works by calling the functions of the parent when creating/copying/freeing an object
+- type recognition is done by the type field in the class struct
+- memory allocation is specific to the struct.
+
+Refcounting
+-----------
+GstData provides threadsafe refcounting. If you create a new object - either by copying or explicit creation -  the refcount is initialized to 1.
+This reference is owned by the creator of the object.
+If the reference count reaches 0, the object is freed. The free function of the class is called for that purpose.
+In accordance with GLib, that uses g_object_(un)ref for everything, gst_data_(un)ref is used and no wrapper macros are created.
+
+MT safety
+---------
+Manipulating data inside an object is not threadsafe unless otherwise noted.
+If an object has a reference count of 1 it is assumed that the reference holder is the only user of that object and he may modify it the way he likes.
+If the reference count is greater than 1, the object may not be modified. If you need to modify it, you have to copy the object and use that copy instead.
+NB: Object creation and refcounting are threadsafe - or must be implemented that way.
+
+Flags
+-----
+Flags work and can be used like the GstObject flags.
+GstData defines only one flag: GST_DATA_READONLY. If this flag is set, you are not allowed to modify the contents of a struct, even if the refcount is 1.
+
+GBoxed
+------
+
+
+GstInstream
+===========
+
+GstInstream is the base class for events and buffers that are passed inside the stream.
+It enhances the GstData struct by
+guint64		offset[GST_OFFSET_TYPES];
+This field describes the offset in the current stream in various different ways:
+GST_OFFSET_BYTES:  The number of bytes from the beginning of the stream.
+GST_OFFSET_TIME:   The timestamp in microseconds. The beginning of the stream equals timestamp 0. In buffers the timestamp should match the beginning of the data.
+GST_OFFSET_FRAMES: This type is specific to the stream and should be defined there. (video will probably use it for frame numbers, audio to count samples)
+If an offset can't be specified, it is set to GST_OFFSET_INVALID, which equals (guint64) -1. The byte offset always has to be specified. It is an error if it is invalid.
+A plugin playing data from an "infinite" source (eg a shoutcast stream from the internet) it should start with byteoffset 0.
+
+
+GstBuffer
+=========
+
+The buffer enhances the GstInstream struct by including a data and a size field.
+
+Memory allocation
+-----------------
+Memory is allocated via a special memchunk implementation, that is threadsafe. The default implementation uses a mutex and GMemChunks.
+FIXME: This is not true, we use g_malloc/g_free for now.
+
+GstBufferClass
+--------------
+GstBufferClasses (note the plural) replace bufferpools. The default class uses g_free/g_malloc for storing data. However, you are free to write your own if
+you need buffers that store data in another way.
+Note however that the copy function needs to supply a writable copy of your buffer.
+
+Subbuffers
+----------
+Subbuffers have been replaced by a special kind of GstBufferClass.
+
+
+Instream events
+===============
+
+GstEventNewMedia
+----------------
+Signals the start of a new stream. This must be send before any buffer of a new stream can be send.
+FIXME: The "must be send" can only be enforced if all elements are event aware. And this is necessary if we don't want to get parts of stream 1 inside stream 2.
+
+GstEventDiscontinuous
+---------------------
+This must be send between buffers, that don't have continuous data. This is necessary for example after seeking or when data is dropped for speed.
+
+GstEventEOS
+-----------
+Signals the end of a stream. Must be send after all data is finished. If you want to start a new stream, don't send this event, send a GstEventNewMedia instead.
+After having processed this event, elements in the pipeline switch their state to paused.
+
+GstEventLength
+--------------
+Specifies the length of the stream.
+FIXME: Write more, when sure how to do this.
+
+Upstream events
+===============
+These will be discussed in a seperate doc.

+GstParse
+========
+
+This document describes how GstParse works. GstParse is the infrastructure used
+to describe pipelines \(or parts thereof) as a string. This powerful yet easy 
+language is for example by the gst-launch command-line utility or in the GConf 
+keys that are used by various applications, such as Rhythmbox or Gst-Player. 
+\(You can find these keys in /system/gstreamer/default in GConf)
+
+The following examples will show commands for gst-launch. Please note that some
+characters need to be escaped when the pipeline is written in the shell as 
+gst-launch command.
+
+If you want to debug the GstParse part of an application, you can start it with
+the --gst-mask=0x10000 command line option.
+
+
+Basics
+======
+
+Elements
+--------
+The most basic thing you specify in a pipeline are elements. You add an element
+by the name of its type, so "filesrc" will add a file source and "identity" will
+add an identity element.
+Gstparse will put all these elements into a toplevel pipeline element.
+  example:#> gst-launch filesrc identity
+This adds a filesrc and an identity element to a pipeline. Of course this 
+pipeline will not run, because the elements are not yet connected.
+
+Properties
+----------
+You can set element properties by specifying them directly after the element in
+the form name=value \(you need to escape here) or name="value" \(you only need to
+escape the " sign.
+  example:#> gst-launch filesrc name=source location="music.mp3"
+This adds a filesrc element with the name "source" pointing to the location
+music.mp3 to your pipeline. \(This pipeline doesn't work either.)
+It's a good idea to set the name property on important elements, because if they
+are referenced \(see below), they will be referenced by name and the name of an
+element is unspecified if it wasn't set before.
+Please note that not all properties can be set yet. You might get a warning like
+  property "myproperty" in element myelement cannot be set
+In that case, please file a feature request. We can't guess all properties in
+advance.
+
+Bins
+----
+If you want to add bins to your pipeline, you can do so by specifying 
+  <bintype> . ( <properties> <elements> )
+in your pipeline. This adds a bin to your pipeline and puts all elements that
+are specified between the brackets inside this bin. You can specify properties
+of the bin directly after the opening bracket.
+There are to special bins: if you don't specify a bintype and no dot either, the
+type of the bin defaults to "bin". And you can use curly brackets { } to get a 
+bin of type "thread".
+  example:#> gst-launch \( { fakesrc pipeline . \( fakesink \) } \)
+This will put a fakesrc element inside a thread inside a bin and a fakesink into
+a pipeline element inside the thread inside the bin.
+Please note that this pipeline would not work, even if the elements were 
+connected properly, because the pipeline only specifies one top level element, 
+the element is not put inside a pipeline but returned directly. So if you don't
+want your elements be put into a pipeline, just add a bin of whatever type you 
+wish around the pipeline.
+
+Links
+-----
+What would a pipeline be without the ability to link the elements?
+Well it's very easy. Just put the link sign, an exclamation mark, between two 
+elements and they will be linked.
+  example:#> gst-launch fakesrc ! fakesink
+This will put the two elements into a pipeline and connect the fakesrc to the
+fakesink. This is the first pipeline that should run - and run it will until you
+terminate it.
+You can't however control which pads are linked, you can reference the pad\(s)
+you want to connect by name with a dot before the name.
+  example:#> gst-launch fakesrc .src ! fakesink
+  example:#> gst-launch fakesrc ! .sink fakesink
+  example:#> gst-launch fakesrc .src ! .sink fakesink
+These examples will all do the exact same thing as the example before. You have
+however referenced the pads you wanted to connect in different ways.
+Another way to reference is to reference the element you want to connect, too.
+In this case you have to add the element name before the dot. You can even not
+reference the pad and only the element name, to connect any pad.
+  example:#> gst-launch fakesrc name=src fakesink name=sink src.src ! sink.sink
+  example:#> gst-launch fakesrc name=src ! sink.sink fakesink name=sink
+  example:#> gst-launch fakesrc name=src src. ! fakesink name=sink
+  example:#> gst-launch fakesrc name=src fakesink name=sink src. ! sink.
+These examples all do the same as the other ones. Please note that we specified
+the element name property to be sure to reference the right element.
+In these examples you may have noticed, that an omitted element name on a link
+automatically means the element directly in front of / after the link is used 
+to create the link to save you some typing work and that not specifying a pad
+name will automatically create 1 connection between the two elements. If more
+than one connection was possible you might end up surprised.
+You may even specify pad lists to connect elements. They are seperated by
+commas.
+  example:#> gst-launch fakesrc ! tee name=tee1 .src0,src1 ! .sink0, sink1 aggregator ! fakesink
+  example:#> gst-launch fakesrc ! tee name=tee  aggregator name=aggregator ! fakesink   tee.src0,src1 ! aggregator.sink0, sink1
+  example:#> gst-launch fakesrc ! tee name=tee .src0 ! .sink0 aggregator name=aggregator ! fakesink   tee.src1 ! aggregator.sink1
+These will all do the same. They will connect the tee twice to the aggregator.
+
+
+Examples
+========
+
+Audio playback
+--------------
+The most common audio pipeline for playing back an mp3 file is this:
+  example:#> gst-launch filesrc location=/path/to/file.mp3 ! mad ! osssink
+
+You can however improve on this by adding visualization:
+  example:#> gst-launch filesrc location=/path/to/file.mp3 ! mad ! tee name=tee ! osssink tee.src%d ! goom ! colorspace ! xvideosink
+Note that the reference of the tee element has a pad named "src%d". This is as
+used by printf and is a useful way to specify request pads where you don't know
+how this pad is named. Yes, the pad name could have been omitted anyway.
+
+If you have jerky playback you might want to use this pipeline threaded so audio
+and video have less chance of problems and you have a little buffer:
+  example:#> gst-launch filesrc location=/path/to/file.mp3 ! mad ! tee name=tee ! { queue ! osssink } tee name=tee { ! queue ! osssink } { tee. ! queue ! goom ! colorspace ! xvideosink }
+Remember to put queues at thread boundaries or it will not work.
+
+Video playback
+--------------
+The basic pipeline to playback a standard mpeg video would be this:
+  example:#> gst-launch filesrc location=/path/to/file.mpeg ! mpegdemux name=demux ! mad ! osssink demux. ! mpeg2dec ! xvideosink
+
+Or using threads for better playback:
+  example:#> gst-launch filesrc location=/path/to/file.mpeg ! mpegdemux name=demux ! { queue ! mad ! osssink } demux. ! { queue ! mpeg2dec ! xvideosink }
+
+For a DivX avi, this might work:
+  example:#> gst-launch filesrc location=/path/to/file.avi ! avidemux name=demux ! { queue ! mad ! osssink } { demux. ! ffdec_msmpeg4 ! xvideosink }
+
+
+If these don't work the video might need different treatment. You should skip to
+the autoplugger part.
+Please be aware of the fact that the mpegdemux element uses pads that are not
+always available. GstParse will wait for them to become available and disable
+the elements that need to be connected by disabling their state until the link
+can be established.
+
+Autoplugging
+------------
+You can also use the spider element for autoplugging. This will take care of
+selecting the right elements for you. Just use this pipeline for all your needs:
+  example:#> gst-launch filesrc location=/path/to/anything ! spider name=spider ! { queue ! osssink } { spider. ! queue ! xvideosink }
+
+To throw you out
+----------------
+Finally the current experimental pipeline that powers the gst-player specified 
+as a simple (ahem...) command line:
+  example:#> gst-launch pipeline. \( { filesrc location=/path/to/anything ! spider name=spider ! { queue ! volume ! \( tee name=tee ! { queue ! \( goom \) ! colorspace ! \( xvideosink \) } tee. ! { queue ! \( osssink \) } \) } spider. ! { queue ! colorspace \( xvideosink \) } } \)

+Abstract
+
+GStreamer is a multimedia streaming framework. It aims to provide developers
+with an abstracted view on media files, while still allowing him to do all
+modifications necessary for the different types ofmedia handling applications.
+
+The framework is utilizes as a graph-based streaming architecture, which is
+implemented in the GStreamer core. Being media agnostic, the Gstreamer core
+uses a plugin-based architecture to provide the building blocks for streams
+processing. The GStreamer plugins collection provides these building blocks
+for multimedia processing.
+
+
+Introduction
+
+While there is a good number of high-quality applications available today for
+audio and video playback such as MPlayer[1] and Xine[2], none of these provide
+a generic media processing backend and a lot of code duplication has been
+going on when trying to provide a generic playback backend. On top of this,
+most application backends are limited in their abilities and only provide
+solutions for the problem space of the application. GStreamer tries to
+overcome these issues by providing a generic infrastructure that allows
+creating all sorts of applications. The applications show the flexibility of
+this approach. Examples are Rhythmbox[3], an audio player, Totem[4], a video
+player, Marlin[5], an audio editor, /*FIXME*/[6], an audio synthesis
+application and fluendo[7], a video streaming server.
+
+Although the GStreamer framework's focus is multimedia processing, the core
+has been used outside the real of multimedia, for example in the gst-sci
+package[8] that provides statistical data analysis.
+
+This paper focusses on the GStreamer core and explains the goals of the
+framework and how the core tries to achieve these by following a simple
+mp3 playback example. 
+
+
+Plugins
+
+To allow easy extensibility, the complete media processing functionality
+inside GStreamer is provided via plugins. Upon initialization a plugin
+registeres its different capabilities with the GStreamer library. These
+capabilities are schedulers, typefind functions or - most common - elements.
+The capabilities of plugins are recorded inside the registry.
+
+
+The registry
+
+The registry is a cache file that is used to inspect certain plugin capabilities
+without the need to load the plugin. As an example those stored capabilites
+enabled automatically determining which plugins must be loaded in order to
+decode a certain media file.
+The gst-register(1) command updates the registry file. The gst-inspect(1)
+command allows querying plugins and their capabilities.
+[Add: output of gst-inspect gstelements]
+
+
+Elements
+
+Elements are at the main building block inside GStreamer. An element takes
+data from 0 to n input sink pads, processes it and produces data for 0 to n
+output source pads. Pads are used to enable data flow between elements in
+GStreamer. A pad can be viewed as a "place" or "port" on an element where
+links may be made with other elements, and through which data can flow to or
+from those elements.  For the most part, all data in GStreamer flows one way
+through a link between elements. Data flows out of one element through one or
+more source pads, and elements accept incoming data through one or more sink
+pads. Elements are ordered in a tree structure by putting them inside
+container elements, called bins. This allows to operate only on the toplevel
+element (called the pipeline element) which propagates these operations to the
+contained elements.
+[Add: gst-editor with a simple mp3 decoder]
+There exists a simple command line tool to quickly construct media pipelines,
+called gst-launch. It helps to get comfortable with using it when developing
+code for or with GStreamer. /* FIXME: write more? */
+As an example the pipeline above would be presented by the command gst-launch
+filesrc ! mad ! alsasink
+
+
+The sample program
+
+/* note that the sample program does not do error checking for simplicities
+ * sake */
+int
+main (int argc, char **argv)
+{
+  GstElement *pipeline;
+
+  gst_init (&argc, &argv);
+  pipeline = gst_parse_launch ("filesrc location=./music.mp3 ! mad ! osssink",
+      NULL);
+  gst_element_set_state (pipeline, GST_STATE_PLAYING);
+  while (gst_bin_iterate (GST_BIN (pipeline)));
+  gst_object_unref (GST_OBJECT (pipeline));
+}
+
+
+Step 1: gst_init
+
+gst_init initializes the GStreamer library. The most important part here is
+loading information from the registry. The other important part is preparing
+the subsystems that need it. It also processes the command line options and
+environment variables specific to GStreamer, like the debugging options.
+
+
+The debugging subsystem
+
+GStreamer includes a powerful debugging subsystem. The need for such a system
+becomes apparent when looking at the way GStreamer works. It is built out of
+little independet elements that process unknown data for long times with or
+without user intervention, realtime requirements or other factors that can
+affect processing. Debugging messages are divided into named categories and 5
+levels for importance, ranging from "log" to "error". Desired debugging output
+can be specified either on the command line or as environment variable
+GST_DEBUG.
+
+
+Step 2: creating the pipeline
+
+A pipeline is set up by creating an element tree, setting options on these
+elements and finally linking their pads.
+Elements are created from their element factories. Element factories contain
+information about elements loaded from the registry. Getting the right element
+factory is done by either knowing its name (in the example "filesrc" is such a
+name) or querying the features of element factories and then deciding which
+one to use. Upon requesting an element, the element factory automatically
+loads the required plugin and returns a newly created element.
+Setting options on elements can be achieved in 2 ways. Either by knowing the
+GObject properties of the element and setting the property directly (the
+location property of filesrc is set in the example pipeline) or by using
+interfaces. Interfaces are used when there is a set of elements that allows the
+same features in a different context. For example there is an interface for
+setting tags that is implemented by different encoding plugins that support
+tag writing as well as tag changing plugins. Another example would be the
+mixer interface that allows changing the volume of an audio element. It is
+implemented by different audio sinks (oss, alsa) as well as the generic volume
+changing element. There is a set of interfaces included in the GStreamer
+Plugins plugin set, but people are of course free to add interfaces and
+elements implementing them.
+The last step in creating a pipeline is linking pads. When attempting to link
+two pads, GStreamer checks that a link is possible and if so, links them. After
+they are linked data may pass through this link. Most of the time (just like
+in this example) convenience funtions are used that automatically select the
+right elements to connect inside a GStreamer pipeline.
+
+
+Step 3: setting the state
+
+GStreamer elements know of four different states: NULL, READY, PAUSED and
+PLAYING. Each state and more important each state transition allows and
+requires different things from elements. State transitions are done step by
+step internally. (Note that in the following description state transitions in
+opposite directions can be assumed to do exactly the reverse thing.) Every
+transition may fail to succeed. In that case the gst_element_set_state
+function will return an error.
+
+
+GST_STATE_NULL to GST_STATE_READY 
+
+GST_STATE_NULL is the 'uninitialized' state. Since it is always possible to
+create an element, nothing that might require interaction or can fail is done
+while creating the element. During the state transition elements are supposed
+to initialize external ressources. A file source opens its file, X elements
+open connections to the X server etc. This ensures that all elements can
+provide the best possible information about their capabilities during future
+interactions. The GStreamer core essentially does nothing. After this
+transition all external dependencies are initialized and supposed to work and
+the element is ready to start.
+
+
+GST_STATE_READY to GST_STATE_PAUSED
+
+During this state change all internal dependencies are resolved. The GStreamer 
+core tries to resolve links between pads by negotiating capabilites of pads.
+(See below for an explanation.) The schedulers will prepare the elements for
+playback and the elements will prepare their internal data structures. After
+this state change is successful, nearly all elements are done with their setup.
+
+
+GST_STATE_PAUSED to GST_STATE_PLAYING
+
+The major difference between these two states is that in the playing state
+data is processed. Therefore the two major things happening here are the
+schedulers finishing their setup and readying their elements to run and the
+clocking subsystem starting the clocks. After this state change succeeded
+elements' processing function may finally be called.
+
+
+capabilities (or short: caps) and negotiation
+
+"Caps" are the format descriptions of the data passed. A caps is a list of
+structures. Each structure describes one "mime type" by n properties and its
+name. Note that "mime type" is used escaped because there is no 1:1 mapping
+between GStreamer caps names and real world mime types though GStreamer tries
+to orient itself at those. Properties are either fixed values, ranges or lists
+of values. There's also two special caps: any and empty.
+The mathematicians reading this should think of caps as a mathematical set of
+formats that is a union of the formats described in every structure. The
+GStreamer core provides functions to union, intersect and subtract caps or
+test them for various conditions (subsets, equality, etc). 
+The negotiation phase works as follows: Both pads figure out all possible caps
+for themselves - most of the time depending on caps on other pads in the
+element. The core then takes those, intersects them and if the intersection
+isn't empty fixates them. Fixation is a process that selects the best possible
+fixed caps from a caps. A fixed caps is a caps that describes only one format
+and cannot be reduced further. After both pads acdepted the fixed caps, its
+format is then used to describe the contents of the buffers that are passed on
+this link. Caps can be serialized and deserialized to a string representation.

+PUSH vs PULL
+
+(This is a writedown of ideas I plan to update whenever I find issues. This 
+should be fleshed out when doing the threadsafety / buffer passing changes.)
+
+GStreamer allows 3 different forms of elements:
+- loopbased:
+Loopbased elements may push and pull from every pad however they want. They're
+therefore heaviest on the scheduler and for latency or similar considerations.
+- chainbased:
+Chainbased elements have one sinkpad. Data gets pushed into a function attached 
+to the pad. => PUSH based
+- getbased:
+Getbased elements have no sinkpads. Every sourcepad has a getfunction that 
+produces data on request. => PULL based
+
+The current problem is that PUSH and PULL based elements are quite limited in 
+what they may or may not do (especially PULL based elements). Some libraries 
+elements link to might also expect the architecture around them to work in a
+specific way (libogg requires the ogg input to be pull-based, JACK is PULL-based
+on sinks and PUSH-based on sinks). This often requires costly wrapping.
+
+Inside a scheduler cothread switches can be avoided (which makes the pipeline 
+faster and scheduling less error-prone) if a PUSH-based element is connected on 
+the push-side of the pipeline. (Same goes with PULL-based on the pull-side). So 
+a pipeline with elements like "pull-pull-loop-push" works without cothread 
+switches while a pipeline like "push-loop-pull" needs 2. Even "push-pull" needs 
+one.
+
+I'm under the impression that push-vs-pull is often best decided by the 
+application in use. (Video players probably prefer PULL because they display on
+demand, live recorders prefer PUSH.) Since many elements probably don't care if 
+they're PUSH or PULL based it would be nice if an element could implement both
+and use whatever suits better. (The code to achieve this should obviously be 
+abstracted into superclasses like videofilter.)

+
+
+Oh! Intro - Jellyman, offspring. Offspring, Jellyman.
+
+GStreamer manages tags in the form of GstTagList objects. A GstTagList (named 
+taglist from now on) consists of zero or more different tags (this will be 
+what I mean when I say tag) where each tag has one or more values attached to 
+it. A tag is registered via gst_tag_register with it's name, translated name 
+(glib calls that nick), a translated description, the GType values for this 
+tag must have and an optional merge function.
+GStreamer provides default caps which are registered in gsttag.c. You can look 
+them up there.
+
+
+You've got serious thrill issues, dude. 
+
+A taglist is primarily thought about as a 1:1 tag:value mapping. Sometimes it 
+is useful to have multiple values for the same tag however. (Multiple artists 
+performing a song). If a merge function is provided at tag registration time, 
+you can attach multiple values to a tag. These values are handled as an 
+ordered list, so you can access each of them with an index. The merge function 
+allows to merge all of them back into a single value.
+If no merge function is provided, only a single value is kept.
+
+
+Tell me, Dory, do you see anything? - Yeah, I see a light. 
+
+There's a whole lot of API provided to change taglists. see gsttag.h for the 
+whole glory. Most of that should be self explaining. Foreach functions, number 
+of values per tag, getting tags and so on. The gst-launch code shows a usage 
+example. The only thing that might be of interest is the merge mode. If you 
+merge two tag lists (via _merge or _insert or even when only adding values via 
+_add_tag) you have to provide a merge mode. The merge mode decides how to 
+handle the merging of caps. If you merge new_tags into old_tags, the different 
+merge modes do this:
+GST_TAG_MERGE_MODE_REPLACE_ALL: Remove all tags from old_tags, use only 
+new_tags.
+GST_TAG_MERGE_MODE_REPLACE: Remove all tags from old_tags where tags from 
+new_tags are available. Keep the others. Insert everything from new_tags.
+GST_TAG_MERGE_MODE_PREPEND: Prepend values from new_tags to the values from 
+old_tags. For single value tags when both are set, use the new_tags tag.
+GST_TAG_MERGE_MODE_APPEND: Same as GST_TAG_MERGE_MODE_PREPEND with new_tags 
+and old_tags swapped.
+GST_TAG_MERGE_MODE_KEEP: Same as GST_TAG_MERGE_MODE_REPLACE with new_tags and 
+old_tags swapped.
+GST_TAG_MERGE_MODE_KEEP_ALL: Same as GST_TAG_MERGE_MODE_REPLACE_ALL with 
+new_tags and old_tags swapped.
+This allows some powerful usage of taglists. I'll describe further down where 
+it really makes sense.
+
+
+Now what? 
+
+There are supposed to be two "producers" of taglists. The first are 
+applications, the second are plugins. (In my tag world domination plans I 
+simply assumed Rhythmbox would start using taglists internally.) Applications 
+can easily create and access them with the API shown above. It should even be 
+reasonably easy to put their values inside gtk objects via foreach loops and 
+similar. Especially because they're all just GValues internally.
+Plugins extract tag lists from the GstBuffer data. They'll have to convert it 
+to taglists obviously. (If you write plugins, please make sure to use the same 
+mapping than other plugins that use the same format. Mappings and plugins for 
+common tagging formats are kept in gst-plugins/gst/tags/* ) Once they have 
+extracted the taglist, they signal they have found tags via the "found-tag" 
+signal. After that they create a tag event and send that down the pipeline. 
+There are convenience functions for this. See code that implements this.
+
+
+Oh, look at me, I'm a flippy little dolphin, let me flip for you!
+
+There are also supposed to be two "consumers" of taglists. Applications and - 
+you guessed it - plugins. Applications obviously want to show the tags of the 
+playing pipeline or store tags for a given file, use them as the basis for 
+editing or whatever.
+Plugins that can set tags implement the GstTagSetter interface. Don't let 
+yourself be fooled by the fact that this interface is an empty interface. Your 
+plugin still has to do something. ;) The interface provides a way to attach 
+tags to elements implementing the interface. Whenever the interface wants to 
+write tags it has to do the following:
+1) Get the tags from the pipeline that you want to write. (This obviously 
+includes storing tags that came in via tag events.)
+2) Merge the user set tags into these tags with the user set merge mode. This 
+is the place where the merge mode allows all te flexibility you may want: 
+adding tags, adding values to tags, overwriting all tags or overwriting only 
+some tags.
+3) Write these tags to the buffer.
+
+
+Hey! You guys made me ink! 
+
+I hope this exciting little intro answered some of your questions. If not, ask 
+more specific questions next time, please. :)

+When talking about time in streams (or "clocking"), people often confuse 3 
+different things that need to be treated seperately. Older designs in GStreamer
+confused those and this made it difficult to design solutions for time 
+management.
+
+1) clock time
+There are many clock providers in GStreamer. In normal circumstances there is 
+only one clock, commonly referred to as the system clock. But in the GStreamer
+case there are others - like a sound card. If a sound card claims to output 
+44100 samples/sec, one second in the sound cards clock has elapsed when 44100 
+samples have been processed. If a webcam claims to deliver 25 pictures/sec a
+second has elapsed after processing 25 pictures. This concept is useful in
+starvation cases - when you use the clock of the sound card and due to high 
+load (or the hard disc of your laptop needing to start spinning again to read
+in an mp3) no samples are processed, the clock does not advance. A system clock
+would merrily go on ticking and make your song jump.
+
+2) element time
+Some elements need to know when to output a buffer. Therefore buffers have 
+timestamps. But there needs to be a way those timestamps to the time reported by
+clocks. This is were element time comes in. GStreamer takes transparently care 
+of this by remembering at what clock time you set your element to PLAYING and 
+computes the time that has passed since then automatically. It takes care of the
+PAUSE state, too. There is even a way to adjust the time in the case of a 
+discontinuity event (which most likely happens after seeking).
+
+3) synchronization
+It is a common case (especially in video playback) that people want to 
+synchronize two elements (audio and video output), so that they report the same
+time. This is an unsolved problem in GStreamer and is only handled implicitly.
+To aid in this, clocks have "clock events". An event happens when an element 
+does something, for example changing states. Because people want to set the 
+states of multiple elements at once, but computers serialize everything, the
+actual state setting on the elements is serialized, too. If however such events
+happen shortly after each other, GStreamer assumes they were meant to happen at
+the same time and handles this as such.

+Scheduling:
+
+ - remove loop/get/chain from GstElement and add a "iterate" method.
+   The iterate method is called with the event (or events) that
+   triggered it, performs some action, and resets the events (file
+   descriptors becoming readable, semaphores, pads becoming readable
+   or writable, or a time occurs).
+
+ - Add GstLoopElement, GstChainElement, etc. for compatibility.
+
+ - Remove existing state handling and create 2 states, "playing" and
+   "stopped".  "playing" means that the iterate() method of the
+   element may be called, that is, the element is allowed to move
+   buffers, negotiate, etc.  "stopped" means that no gstreamer-ish
+   things happen to an element, only gobject-ish.  A separate
+   reset() method will handle the difference between READY and NULL.
+
+ - Add a flag "ready" to GstElement that is under the control of the
+   element.  If the element is ready to stream, it sets this flag,
+   and the entire pipeline starts streaming.  (This is basically
+   the difference between PAUSED and PLAYING.)  For example, osssink
+   won't set the ready flag until the device is opened and there is
+   a buffer available to write to the device.
+
+ - Scheduling of elements and movement of buffers will be timed by
+   clocks.  
+
+
+
+Example #1:
+
+ Pipeline: sinesrc ! osssink
+
+ - The application creates the pipeline and sets it to "playing".
+
+ - The clock is created and set to "paused".
+
+ - sinesrc.iterate() decides to watch for the event "src pad
+   negotiation" and sets the available caps on the pad.
+
+ - osssink.iterate() opens device, determines available caps, and
+   sets the available caps on the pad.  Then it decides to wait for
+   "sink pad negotiation".
+
+ - The scheduler realizes that the two elements are waiting for
+   negotiation, so it negotiates the link.
+
+ - sinesrc.iterate() sets the "ready" flag (because it needs no more
+   preparation to stream) and decides to watch for the event "src
+   pad ready to accept buffer".
+
+ - osssink.iterate() decides to watch for the event "sink pad has
+   available buffer".
+
+ - The scheduler realizes that sinesrc.srcpad is now ready, so it
+   calls sinesrc.iterate()
+
+ - sinesrc.iterate() creates a buffer and pushes it, and decides to
+   wait for the same event.
+
+ - The scheduler realizes that osssink.sinkpad now has a buffer, so
+   it calls osssink.iterate().
+
+ - osssink.iterate() is now ready to stream, so it sets the "ready"
+   flag and waits for "time 0".
+
+ - The pipeline is now completely ready, so the clock may be
+   started.  A signal is fired to let the application know this
+   (and possibly change the default behavior).
+
+ - The clock starts with the time 0.  The scheduler realizes this,
+   and decides to schedule osssink.
+
+ - osssink.iterate() is called, and writes the buffer to the device.
+   This starts the clock counting.  (Actually, the buffer could be
+   written by the clock code, since presumably the clock is related
+   to osssink.)  iterate() then waits for "sink pad has available
+   buffer".
+
+ We're now basically in streaming mode.  A streaming cycle:
+
+ - osssink.iterate() decides the audio output buffer is full enough,
+   so it waits for "time X", where X is the time when the output
+   buffer will be below some threshold.
+
+ - osssink.iterate() waits for "sink pad has available buffer"
+
+ - sinesrc.iterate() creates and pushes a buffer, then waits for
+   "src pad ready".
+
+
+ Further ideas:
+
+ - osssink can set a hard deadline time, which means that if it is
+   not scheduled before that time, you'll get a skip.  Skipping
+   involves setting osssink to "not ready" and pauses the clock.
+   Then the scheduler needs to go through the same process as above
+   to start the clock.
+
+ - As a shortcut, osssink can say "I need a buffer on the sinkpad
+   at time X".  This information can be passed upstream, and be used
+   in filters -- filter.sinkpad says "I need a buffer at time X-N",
+   where N is the latency of the filter.
+
+
+Example #2:
+
+ Pipeline: osssrc ! osssink
+ 
+ - The application creates the pipeline and sets it to "playing".
+
+ - The clock is created and set to "paused".
+
+ - negotiation happens roughly as in example #1, although osssrc
+   additionally opens and prepares the device.
+
+ - osssrc.iterate() sets the "ready" flag (because it needs no more
+   preparation to stream) and waits for "time 0", since it presumably
+   can't wait for the file descriptor (audio input hasn't been
+   enabled on the device yet.)
+
+ - osssink.iterate() decides to watch for the event "sink pad has
+   available buffer".
+
+ - The scheduler realizes the deadlock and (somehow) tells osssink
+   that it can't pre-roll.  (This needs more work)  In other words,
+   osssink can't be the clock master, but only a clock slave.
+
+ - osssink.iterates() agrees to start at time SOME_LATENCY, sets the
+   "ready" flag, and waits for a buffer on its sink pad.
+
+ - The pipeline is now completely ready, so the clock may be
+   started.  A signal is fired to let the application know this
+   (and possibly change the default behavior).
+
+ - The clock starting causes two things to happen: osssrc starts
+   the recording of data, and osssink starts the outputting of data.
+   The data being output is a chunk of silence equal to SOME_LATENCY.
+
+ - osssrc.iterate() is called for "time 0", does nothing, and waits
+   on the file descriptor (via the scheduler, of course).  All waiting
+   on file descriptors should have an associated timeout.
+
+ - osssrc.iterate() is called when the file descriptor is ready,
+   reads a chunk of data, and pushes the buffer.  It then waits for
+   its file descriptor to be ready.
+
+ - osssink.iterate() is called

+plans:
+
+ - The primary object that applications deal with is a GstPipeline.  A
+   given pipeline is connected to a particular main loop (GMainLoop for
+   glib, etc.).  Calls to gst_ functions for objects owned by that
+   pipeline must be done from the context of the pipeline's main loop.
+   Signals fired by elements are marshalled in the pipeline's main
+   loop.
+
+   Notably, this means the gst_ API is not necessarily thread-safe.
+   However, it is safe to operate on different GstPipelines from
+   different threads.  This makes it possible, for example, for
+   rhythmbox to play music and gather metadata from different threads
+   using different pipelines.  Likewise, it's also possible to do
+   both in the same thread.
+
+ - The primary method of scheduling an element is through a generic
+   'iterate()' method.  The iterate method explicitly tells the core
+   what it is waiting for (a specific time, pads to have available
+   data, etc.), and the core calls the iterate method when these
+   "triggers" happen.  GstElement subclasses will be created to
+   emulate 0.8-style get/chain/loop methods.  Existing elements will
+   be converted to the new subclasses rather than implement the
+   iterate method directly, unless there is a compelling reason to
+   do so.  Iterate implementations are expected not to block, ever.
+
+   Rationale: This makes it possible to create completely non-blocking
+   elements.
+
+ - Scheduling elements will be done in either a threaded or
+   non-threaded way.  The idle handler that is called by a pipeline's
+   main loop determines which elements are ready to be iterated
+   (based on their triggers), and puts them into a ready queue.  In
+   the non-threaded case, the idle handler then calls the iterate()
+   method on each element in the ready queue.  In the threaded case,
+   additional helper threads (which are completely owned by the
+   pipeline) are used to call the iterate methods.
+
+   Note that in the threaded case, elements may not always be run
+   in the same thread.
+
+   Some elements are much easier to write if they run in the same
+   thread as the main loop (i.e., elements that are also GUI widgets).
+   An element flag can be set to make the manager always call the
+   iterate method in the manager context (i.e., in the main loop
+   thread).  Also, elements like spider need to make core calls
+   which may not be allowed from other threads.
+
+   Rationale: Doing all bookkeeping in a single thread/context makes
+   the core code _much_ simpler.  This bookkeeping takes only a
+   minimal amount of CPU time, less than 5% of the CPU time in a
+   rhythmbox pipeline.  There is very little benefit to spreading
+   this over multiple CPUs until the number of CPUs is greater than
+   ~16, and you have _huge_ pipelines.  Also, a single-threaded
+   manager significantly decreases the number of locks necessary
+   in the core, decreasing lock contention (if any) and making it
+   easier to understand deadlocks (if any).
+
+ - There are essentially two types of objects/structures.  One type
+   includes objects that are derived from GObject, and are passed in
+   function calls similarly to gtk.  The other type includes objects
+   (structures, really) that are not reference counted and passed
+   around similar to how GstCaps works in 0.8.  That is, functions
+   that take 'const GstCaps *' do not take ownership of the passed
+   object, whereas functions that take 'GstCaps *' do.  Similar is
+   true for return values.
+
+ - The concept of GstBuffer from 0.8 will be split into two types.
+   One type will focus solely on holding information pertaining to
+   ownership of a memory area (call this GstMemBuffer), and the
+   other type will focus solely in transfering information between
+   elements (call this GstPipeBuffer).  In case you get confused,
+   GstMemBuffers _are not_ transferred between elements, and
+   GstPipeBuffers _do not_ own the memory they point to.
+
+   In general, GstPipeBuffers point to (and reference) a GstMemBuffer.
+   GstMemBuffers are GObjects.  GstPipeBuffers are structs, like
+   GstCaps.  GstPipeBuffers have timestamps, durations, and flags.
+   GstMemBuffers contain read/write flags.  There are no subbuffers
+   for either type, because they are not necessary.  Essentially,
+   GstPipeBuffers completely replace the concept of subbuffers.
+
+   (I'd like to continue to use the name GstBuffer for GstPipeBuffers,
+   since its usage is much more common in elements.)
+
+   Rationale: Memory regions need an ultimate owner and reference
+   counting.  However, chunks passed around between elements need
+   to be small and efficient.  These goals are non-overlapping and
+   conflicting, and thus are inappropriate to be combined in the
+   same class.
+
+ - Core objects should have very few (if any) public fields.  This
+   means that accessor macros will all be eliminated and replaced
+   with accessor functions.
+
+   Rationale: This makes it possible to change the core more during
+   an ABI-stable series.
+   
+ - Remove pluggable scheduling.
+
+   Rationale: We need one good scheduler.  Having multiple schedulers
+   is directly opposed to this goal.
+
+ - 0.8-style element states are split up.  One state (AppState)
+   indicates what the application wants the element to be doing,
+   and is completely under the control of the application.  The
+   other state (ElementState) indicates what the element is actually
+   doing, and is under control of the element.  If the application
+   wants an element to pause, it sets the AppState to PAUSED, and
+   the element eventually changes its ElementState to PAUSED (and
+   fires a signal).  If the element has an error or EOS, it sets
+   its ElementState to SOME_STATE and fires a signal, while the
+   AppState remains at PLAYING.  The actual number and descriptions
+   of states has not been discussed.
+
+   Rationale: It's pretty obvious that we're mixing concepts for
+   elements states in 0.8.
+
+ - getcaps() methods will be replaced by an element_allowed_caps()
+   field in the pad.  The primary reason for this is because
+   renegotiation only needs to happen when circumstances change.
+   This is more easily done by a field in GstPad and notification
+   of peers when this changes.
+
+   Somewhere, there's a document I wrote about completely redoing
+   caps.

+x[v]imagesink should call gst_pad_set_bufferalloc_function() on
+their sink pads with a bufferalloc implementation.  This bufferalloc
+function is to allocate buffers that _peers_ will send _to_ that pad.
+
+A trivial version of a bufferalloc function, i.e., one that just
+allocates normal buffers:
+
+static GstBuffer *
+gst_ximagesink_sink_bufferalloc (GstPad *pad, guint64 offset, guint
+size)
+{

+}
+
+static void
+gst_ximagesink_buffer_free (GstData *data)
+{
+  g_free (GST_BUFFER_DATA (data));
+}
+
+The hard part is going through each element, and every time it
+allocates a buffer using gst_buffer_new_and_alloc () that is then
+sent to a sink pad, the call should be replaced with
+gst_pad_alloc_buffer (sinkpad, offset, size).

+Problem #1:
+
+  How does the core allow the application to choose appropriate
+  caps in the following cases:
+
+    videotestsrc ! xvimagesink
+
+    videotestsrc ! identity ! xvimagesink
+
+    videotestsrc ! videoscale ! xvimagesink
+ 
+  Goals:
+  
+  - Give the application a clear overview of the formats available
+    and the elements involved.
+
+  - Provide reasonable defaults in as many cases as possible.
+
+  - Allow specialized elements to suggest reasonable defaults.
+
+
+
+Problem #2:
+
+  How does the API express to an autoplugger what an element does?
+
+  Currently, "colorspace" and "videoscale" have approximately the
+  same pad template caps.  Until the autoplugger plugs and looks,
+  it has no way to determine that colorspace changes format, and
+  videoscale changes size.
+
+
+
+Problem #3:
+
+  How do we properly handle codec metadata?
+
+  Solution #3a:
+
+    Stream initialization event.  This event would be held by all
+    src pads, and pushed to sink pads upon connection, and would
+    flow downstream.
+
+  Solution #3b:
+    
+    Put a buffer in the caps.
+
+
+Problem #4:
+
+  (Related to #1) How does one specify that a converter should limit
+  it's conversion?  I.e., audioconvert to not change number of channels,
+  or audioscale upsample by 20%.  Basically, this means caps based on
+  other caps.
+
+  Solution #4a:
+
+    One can put a converter element into a special bin:
+
+      specialbin.( specialidentity ! converter ! specialidentity )
+
+    Specialbin can then interfere with caps negotiation all it wants.
+
+
+Problem #5:
+
+  (Related to #3)  How do we specify stream format information that
+  is non-critical and optional, such as pixel aspect ratio on raw
+  video?
+
+Problem #6:
+
+  How do we specify the difference between nominal values and actual
+  values, such as video frame rate?  The actual frame rate may not
+  correspond to the nominal frame rate in the caps, and often a guess
+  is listed.

+This is a list of things to check in elements.
+
+
+
+1. Add a "Element-Checklist-Version: 1" comment
+
+This comment is to indicate which items on this checklist have been
+checked, so that future checkers can skip things that you've already
+carefully checked.  This number should obviously be updated whenever
+you do additional checks.  Ideally, you should not do checks out of
+order, but using "1, also 4-6" is acceptable.
+
+
+2. Each pad should have a pad template
+
+Create and register a pad template to the element class.
+
+
+3. config.h
+
+Make sure that each .c file includes config.h (conditionally on
+HAVE_CONFIG_H).  Make sure that each .h file does _not_ include
+config.h.
+
+4. src event handling
+
+Every element having multiple sink pads or having a specific need to handle
+src events in a different manner than the default event handler should do that 
+correctly. Correctly means that :
+
+- It should not leak the event if it is handled (gst_event_unref)
+- It should call return gst_pad_event_default (pad, event) for all non handled 
+localy events. Otherwise it breaks navigation, seeking, etc...
+- it should return a TRUE/FALSE boolean if the localy handled event was handled.
+
+
+
+
+other ideas:
+
+- plugins should avoid using gst_caps_to_string() in debug statement.
+  They should use %"GST_PTR_FORMAT" instead.  Check all usage for leaks.

+  "template_caps"

+
+ - In response to changes in the internal state of the element or in
+   the peer_allowed_caps of any other pad owned by the element, the
+   element should update allowed_caps of a pad.
+
+ - Pads are initially created with negotiable as FALSE.  When an
+   element wants to indicate that negotiation is allowable, it should
+   set negotiable to TRUE.
+
+ - In response to a negotiate signal, an element should copy the caps
+   in "allowed_caps" to "negotiated_caps", and extract any information
+   needed to handle the format.  At this point, "allowed_caps" is
+   guaranteed to be fixed.

+<ds> I'd like to split it up into manageable "projects"
+<ds> hopefully some of which we can recruit others to do
+<Company> i'd like a decision about if we drop threads
+<ds> in what sense?
+<ds> threads being not required?
+<Company> threads being not part of the API
+<ds> or threads being not used
+<Company> so no thread safety considerations
+<ds> I would like threads to not be part of the API
+<ds> requiring apps/plugins to be written thread-safely is insane
+<Company> the question is this: If someone calls gst_element_set_state (element, state), does he have to marshal it into the correct thread himself or not?
+<ds> no
+<ds> reason being: we already have to deal with subthreads
+<ds> we == the core
+<Company> then you'll have a lot of problems
+<Company> i'd like to just drop subthreads and be done with it
+--> StyXman (~mdione@200.59.114.71) has joined #gstreamer
+<ds> and run everything in one thread?
+<Company> yes
+<Company> schedulers are free to use threads though
+<ds> this is obviously a retreat
+<Company> right
+<ds> but perhaps a strategic one
+<Company> otherwise you have to guarantee that you get no races
+<ds> I've seen this as a viable option for some time
+<Company> there's stuff that just does not work as is currently
+<ds> it always seemed difficult to convince other people that it's the right thing to do
+<ds> for example, wtay
+<Company> like setting xwindow ids, changing states or app-events
+<Company> like seeks
+<-- iain has quit ("leaving")
+<Company> all of this has the typical thread issues currently: it sometimes works and sometimes crashes the app
+<Company> and that's not acceptable to me
+<ds> let's do it
+<Company> if you look at my 0.10 code, I've tried to have GstObjects belong to a "context"
+<ds> this all fits into the idea that I think we should be a lot more like gtk architecturally
+<ds> for example, gtk doesn't have anything like caps negotiation, where elements call each other recursively
+<Company> and have functions ensure they're in the right context or otherwise marshal
+<Company> yes it does
+<ds> ?
+<Company> size requests and allocations
+<ds> but that's more like how I want it -- setting a property and firing a signal telling others that it's updated
+<ds> as i understand it
+<Company> though gtk has the bonus of being a tree which we don't have, we have a directed, maybe cyclic graph
+<Company> and for caps, the graph isn't even directed
+<Company> gtk is far too simple for gst
+<ds> true
+<Company> i can't even come up with an analogy to a video transcoder
+<ds> but we do some relatively simple stuff in a complicated way
+<-- StyXman (~mdione@200.59.114.71) has left #gstreamer
+<Company> like?
+<ds> caps negotiation
+<Company> that's not simple
+<ds> passing around the data should be
+<ds> was it you or thomasvs that wanted to split core headers into app headers and plugin headers?
+<Company> I definitely wanted that
+<Company> app/plugin/registry to be exact
+<ds> registry?
+<ds> for functions that access "internal" stuff?
+<Company> stuff an app normally doesn't touch
+<Company> so we can do something like declare the "app" stuff supported for a longer time
+<ds> oooh, good call
+<ds> I'm sold
+<Company> so, now that threads are gone, what are the biggies I want in 0.10?
+<Company> 1) non-blocking main-loop integrated processing
+<ds> that's rather important if you don't have threads :)
+<Company> right
+<Company> but it works in my gst-01.0 stuff already
+<Company> minus the elements that need to be ported of cause
+<Company> which aren't that many fortunately
+<Company> though some are hard (like gnomevfs), because they have no non-blocking API
+<ds> a subclass of GstElement that fires up a helper thread?
+<ds> (dirty, but it works)
+<Company> probably
+<ds> - autopluggers would be easier to write if there was a core method
+<ds>   to do what plugidentities do.
+<Company> no clue how to implement that
+<ds> there's also a note about bins being more involved with negotiation
+<Company> that's the next biggie: 2) fix the negotiation process to allow good autoplugging
+<ds> that was something I thought about last time around
+<Company> bins?
+<ds> that sounds like something I'd work on
+<ds> GstBin
+<Company> the only reason bhins still exist for me is to group elements
+<ds> so that a bin subclass could override how its children are negotiated
+<ds> much like GtkBin, actually
+<ds> and allocation
+<Company> hum
+<Company> how do you solve that issue with links that are only partly inside the bin and partly inside another one?
+<ds> that would be up to the parent (grandparent?)
+<Company> so all links must be in the same toplevel bin?
+<ds> yes
+<ds> isn't that the case currently?
+<ds> probably not checked
+<Company> pfff
+<Company> currently you can do anything
+<ds> heh
+<ds> what about state changes?
+<Company> dunno
+<Company> it's not really important for me
+<Company> apart from the EOS stuff
+<ds> I'd like states to be split into "what state does the app want me to be in" and "what state am I in"
+<ds> with the latter being under control of the element
+<Company> yeah, that'd be nice
+<ds> that way, you don't have multiple people trying to control the state
+<Company> we definitely need to fix EOS
+<Company> i'm not sure how we should handle errors
+<ds> element errors?
+<Company> yeah, if we want to explicitly unset errors or not
+<Company> currently on error the element goes to paused
+<ds> it's easier with actual_state
+<Company> in theory i just set it to PLAYING again and continue?
+<ds> the actual_state goes to PAUSED and fires a signal
+<Company> dunno, maybe actual_state should go to ERROR
+<ds> yeah
+<Company> that'd require gst_element_unset_error though
+<ds> with actual_state, we can add states without thinking too hard
+<Company> but if you can just unset it, why not just do it and continue
+<ds> the app may want to be involved
+<ds> especially to get the error message
+<ds> do we want a separate api section for autopluggers?
+<Company> why would we want that?
+<ds> or make it part of registry
+<Company> maybe s/registry/internal/ or some other name
+<ds> because autopluggers may want to access internal information that we wouldn't expose to apps or plugins
+<ds> could you add gst/gstcompat.c to your arch repo?
+<Company> hm
+<Company> what internal info would an autoplugger need
+<ds> depends
+<ds> whatever replaces plugidentities
+<Company> a simple one (decoder) just needs caps and ranks
+<ds> I meant for negotiation information
+<Company> hm
+<Company> no, i don't want a seperate section for it
+<Company> just put it in "internal", "extended" or whatever
+<ds> ok
+<ds> do we want to plan for the app api to be ABI compatible past 0.10?
+<ds> er, that's silly
+<ds> er, kinda silly
+<Company> API compat
+<Company> you could achieve ABI compat if you expose all objects just as typedefs

+
+After some discussion on IRC, I think it's time to propose a
+formal plan for the next 6 months or so to the list.
+
+I think most people are in agreement that we need a period of time
+in which we can focus on improving non-core bits (like elements,
+schedulers, autopluggers, applications, etc.)  In the last cycle,
+there was a lot of time spent with a significant number of plugins
+broken, and it's realistic to assume that this could happen again
+in a 0.9 unstable series.
+
+What I propose is:
+
+ - We continue to develop the 0.8.x series as HEAD, with the obvious
+   requirement that all changes be ABI/API compatible.
+ 
+ - API additions are encouraged, as long as they are well-thought-out.
+
+ - Significant API additions should be developed on a separate branch
+   (not HEAD) to test out any bugs.
+
+In mid-August (or so, in order to coordinate with GNOME-2.8), we have
+two options:
+
+ - Continue with 0.8.x releases, obviously ABI compatible with 0.8.0.
+
+ - or, remove deprecated functions, readjust the padding on structures,
+   perhaps make a few additional ABI changes [1], and quickly go to
+   0.10.0.
+
+I prefer the latter, although we don't have to decide that until
+later.  In either case, there should be no API changes that affect
+more than a bare minimum of elements or applications.
+
+A few things that we won't be able to do without a true unstable
+branch are:
+
+ - using GstStructure for all GstEvents.
+
+ - significant clock changes
+
+ - significant scheduling changes
+
+ - separation of headers into application and plugin headers
+
+ - anything that requires modification of every plugin
+
+There are perils with having HEAD being the stable branch,
+specifically that bugs can creep in and accidentally cause regressions
+in releases.  I'm hoping that the introduction of media regression
+testing and also the development of new testsuites will keep this
+to a minimum.  Don't forget that accidental bugs that get into
+releases typically cause rude IRC conversations, which we really
+don't need.  Please keep the bugs (and the rudeness) to a minimum.
+
+Also, keep in mind that we will have to live with 0.8's unfixable
+bugs for an entire year.[2]

+Dynamic pads are pads that are created while the element is playing.
+This means that the element will create a new pas depending on the 
+media type it is handling. For example, the mpeg1pdemuxer element will
+create one or more video pads and one or more audio pads depending
+on the number of elementtary streams found in the media stream.
+
+The element will present its dynamic pads with the padtemplate list
+attached to the elementfactory. both the MIME type, direction, presence
+and properties of a pad can be obtained from the elementfactory using 
+the padtemplates. 
+
+Dynamic pad usually have the presence indicator set to 
+GST_PAD_SOMETIMES. This indicated that the pad might become
+available at runtime. When the pad is actually created in the 
+element, the element will signal the new_pad signal. This signal can
+then be used to attach a desired (compatible) element to the 
+pad.
+
+For certain elements, like a tee and a muxer, we need another pad 
+presence flag: GST_PAD_REQUEST. With this flag, the 
+elementfactory will announce that some of the pads are available on
+request. For the tee element, for example, one might obtain a new output
+pad by looking up a suitable padtemplate (temp) and performing:
+gst_element_request_new_pad (element, temp). The element will then
+create a new pad from the template (sink or source) and will return
+a handle to it. You can then connect elements to this new pad.
+
+The muxer element (an avi encoder, for example) might expose several
+padtemplates for audio and video. The typical usage pattern for the
+muxer would then be: create a compressor element (JPEG). Get the
+src pad of the compressor, Request a new pad from the element using the
+padtemplate provided by the compressor src pad and connect the 
+compressor element to this pad.
+
+An element that can be requested for a new pad has to implement the
+gst_element_request_new_pad method and perform the nessesary steps 
+to create a pad from that template. 
+
+This interesting behaviour can be extended to ghostpads too. A 
+compound element (a bin with internal elements) will also expose some
+padtemplates, either from the internal elements or from itself. Along
+with a new GstGhostPad class, this  also solves the naming conflicts 
+we might have with the ghostpads. The compound element will override
+the request_new_pad function and figure out which element it needs
+to get a pad from.
+
+Related to this solution: we will move the tee element to the
+gst/elements/ directory because there is no point in having the 
+header files anymore. The new pad request API will become a feature 
+of gstelement so gsttee becomes a real element too.

+= distributed gstreamer pipelines =
+
+The idea is to have a proxy element for remote elements so that you can treat
+the whole pipeline as a local one. The proxy element creates the real instance
+by talking to GOD (GStreamer Object Daemon, GObject Daemon, ...) on the
+respective machine.
+
+At runtime when the proxy-element receives data it sends it to the remote
+element and after processing it gets it back and forwards it to the element.
+The challenge is to optimize links when multiple conected elements are on the
+same remote machine so that the data gets passed directly there.
+
+== proxy creation ==
+
+In addition to
+GstElement* gst_element_factory_make        (const gchar *factoryname,
+                                             const gchar *name);
+
+we need:
+GstElement* gst_element_factory_make_remote (const gchar *factoryname,
+                                             const gchar *name,
+                                             GstRemoteFactory *remote);
+
+and some API to get a remote factory handle via hostname lookup, ip address
+lookup or even zeroconf (avahi).
+
+== remote server ==
+
+The remote server manages pipelines with elements that are bound to the proxies.
+Each pipeline has an id, that refers to the client+the clients pipeline address.
+Proxyelements supply the client. pipeline address pair when creating remote
+elements.
+
+== issues / thoughts ==
+
+* we need to distribute the clock
+* is dataprotocol-library useful to send events, data, property- and state-
+  changes
+* we need to sync the remote pipelines with the main-pipeline

+
+== index handling ==
+For avidemux I currently have a big patch doing memory optimized index handling.
+It basically thins out the index to save memory. Right now it only keeps index
+entries marked with the avi keyframe flag.
+
+In gstreamer core we have some indexing objects. They are curently used nowhere.
+The idea is to use them and to make the index strategy plugable or configurable
+at run time.
+
+The challenge is then to rewrite muxers and demuxers to use them instead of the
+built in index logic.
+
+This way the different requirements of desktop and embedded platforms could be
+encapsulated in the indexer strategy.
+
+== ranking ==
+Autopluggers like playbin and decodebin use the element caps plus static ranks
+to create piplines.
+The rank of an elemnt right now refers to the quality/maturity of the element.
+Elements with higher rank should be functionaly more complete. If we have
+multiple elements that are feature complete there is a draw.
+
+There are more decission criteria thinkable:
+* target processor (CPU,DSP,GPU)
+* ressource usage (CPU, memory)
+* license (proprietary, open source)
+* quality (in terms of the audio/image quality)
+
+One problem of taking criteria like quality and performance into account when
+autoplugging, is that elements might have objects-properties that influence
+them.
+
+Beside adding more ranking criteria, we might consider adding an overridable
+mechanism for picking elements (basically registry filters that not decide on
+the base of ranks). Applications might choose the filter mechanism based on the
+use-case (which gstreamer not know right now).
+
+== g_malloc vs. g_try_malloc ==
+g_malloc/g_new should not be used when allocating space of a size that is
+derived from a value found in the file. Instead one should use g_try_malloc or
+g_try_new and check the return value.
+
+$ find . -name "*.c" -exec grep "g_malloc" {} \; | wc -l
+190
+$ find . -name "*.c" -exec grep "g_try_malloc" {} \; | wc -l
+0
+$ find . -name "*.c" -exec grep "g_new" {} \; | wc -l
+398
+$ find . -name "*.c" -exec grep "g_try_new" {} \; | wc -l
+3
+
+This is not strickly related to embedded, but its easier to crash gstreamer on
+embedded this way.

+
+  The mixer intercepts eos and returns false.  mad1 is removed from the
+  eos providers and mixer is added.
+
+  (At this point, the mixer might choose to disconnect mad1->src and
+  mixer->sink1 pads, since it's received eos on mad1->src)
+
+  mixer will not send out eos since it hasn't received eos from 
+  mad2->src.
+
+  After a while, disksrc2 will detect end of stream, and eos will finally
+  propagate to mixer.  mixer might disconnect mad->src2, and after
+  realizing all of it's sources have reached eos, it sends out the final
+  buffer and fires EOS.
+
+  At this point, filesink will return false, mixer will be removed as an
+  eos provider, and filesink will write out it's final buffer and close
+  the file on disk.  At this point, it fires eos, and since it's the last
+  eos provider, the parent can fire eos.

+Some notes on the error handling introduced after 0.7.3
+
+- there are four domains for errors:
+  - CORE: core GStreamer errors
+  - LIBRARY: supporting library errors
+  - RESOURCE: errors accessing resources (files, network, memory, ...)
+  - STREAM: errors in the data stream
+- Each error in GStreamer or plug-ins can be put under one of these four.
+- the enum is called Gst(Domain)Error and has GST_(DOMAIN)_ERROR_(CODE) members
+  (see GError API docs for rationale)
+- each of the enums starts with _FAILED at 1 (with FAILED being the generic
+  error if none of the others applies)
+- second in the enum is TOO_LAZY, which allows us to keep track of those errors
+  that we haven't categorized yet.  This means they really should either move
+  to another one, or a new one ought to be created.
+- each enum ends with NUM_ERRORS
+
+- elements call gst_element_error to signal an error:
+  gst_element_error (element, domain, code, message, debug);
+  With :
+  - element being the one signalling the error
+  - domain one of CORE, LIBRARY, RESOURCE, STREAM
+  - code one of the suffixes in the Gst(Domain)Error enum
+  - message is either NULL (to signal the standard error message for the
+    given domain and code), or a printf-like set with the format being
+    marked for translation.
+    The string should start with a capital and end in a period so it forms
+    a complete sentence.
+    The string can/should be shown to the user of an application.
+  - debug is either NULL or a non-translated debug string, which can be used
+    to diagnose errors after they've happened.
+    The string can be shown to the user when he asks for additional debug info.
+    A useful macro is GST_ERROR_SYSTEM, which prints out the system error
+    that explains the failure by using g_strerror.
+
+- Some example calls:
+
+      gst_element_error (src, RESOURCE, OPEN_READ,
+        (_("Could not open file \"%s\" for reading"), src->filename),
+        GST_ERROR_SYSTEM);
+
+      The message is specified since we have more information:
+          - the resource is a file 
+          - we know the file name
+
+      gst_element_error (element, CORE, NEGOTIATION, NULL, NULL);
+ 
+      This is a simple negotiation error.  The default message will be
+      signaled, telling the user that GStreamer had an internal error.
+
+      gst_element_error (ebml, RESOURCE, READ, NULL,
+                         ("Read error at position %llu (0x%llx)",
+                         pos, pos));
+
+      The plugin asked to read on the underlying resource (using bytestream),
+      but failed.  The user will get a generic read error.  The debug info
+      will contain the exact position in the stream at which the read error
+      occured.

+EARLY DOCUMENT, NOT EXACTLY AS IMPLEMENTED
+------------------------------------------
+
+EVENTS RFC
+==========
+
+
+Scope
+-----
+This document tries to describe a possible implementation of an event
+system for GStreamer that is able to handle all known problems and works
+better than the current (0.3.1) system which evolved over time.
+
+
+Definition 
+----------
+
+The event system is designed to be a mechanism for communication between 
+elements. They are used to get information to the right point when this
+point cannot be known in advance.
+Events can be generated by either an element or the application and are
+processed by elements.
+
+
+Event Handling
+--------------
+
+Events may be inserted into a pipeline in the PAUSED or PLAYING state. Some
+events may travel during the PAUSED state, others may only travel when PLAYING.
+The insertion of events during the NULL or READY state should be supported if
+at all possible. Events may not be processed in those states though.
+After an event is inserted into the pipeline, no assumption may be made on how
+the event will be processed. It is eg wrong to assume that an event that is 
+inserted at the beginning of the pipeline may come out at the end.
+There are 3 different directions an event can be processed.
+
+* downstream events
+
+  Downstream events are inserted on source pads and travel along the pipeline.
+  They are handled like buffers and processed in order. If event x is inserted
+  into a pipeline after buffer y, they are guaranteed to travel in that order.
+  Downstream events therefore only travel when the pipeline is PLAYING.
+  Downstream events must be handled by the routines that handle buffers, too.
+  An example downstream event is the event signalling that the stream has ended.
+  Please keep in mind that downstream events take the same way as buffers. So a
+  ghost pad will never receive these events.
+
+* upstream events
+  
+  Upstream events are inserted on sink pads and travel backwards through the 
+  pipeline. They travel as fast as possible. Source pads must have a handler
+  function in place to process events. A default handler is implemented.
+  An example upstream event is an event that seeks inside the stream.
+  Please keep in mind that upstream events take the same way as buffers in reverse
+  direction. This means that ghost pads will never receive them.
+
+* vertical events
+  
+  Vertical events travel from elements to their parents. They are targetted at
+  the application. Vertical events should be used for information that an 
+  application cannot receive in an easy way by using callbacks or properties.
+  Vertical events are send to the application by the pipeline that collects those
+  events and supplies a callback for the application. Vertical events are also only
+  happening when the pipeline is in PAUSED or PLAZING state.
+  An example vertical event is the error event informing the application about
+  unexpected behaviour.
+
+
+The GstEvent object
+-------------------
+
+struct _GstEvent {
+  GstData data;
+
+  GstEventType  type;
+  guint64	timestamp;
+  GstObject	*src;
+
+  union {
+    ...
+  } event_data;
+};
+
+data:       The parent object.
+type:       The type of the event. GStreamer aims to keep the number of different
+            plugin types as small as possible.
+timestamp:  The time when the event was created. This property is used to identify
+            duplicated events. If the application inserts an event, the timestamp 
+            is set by the element receiving the event from the application.
+src:        The element that created the event. If an application inserts an event,
+            the element that received the event from the application sets itself as
+            the source.
+event_data: data specific to the event type.
+
+
+The different event types
+-------------------------
+
+The following names in brackets correspong to the event's type property.
+
+GST_EVENT_DISCONTINUOUS
+direction(s): downstream
+event_data: struct {
+              GstDiscontType type;
+            } discontinuous;
+This event is used to indicate that the current stream does not continue. Possible 
+indications are a new stream (type = GST_DISCONT_NEW), the happening of a seek 
+(type = GST_DISCONT_SEEK) or the end of the stream when no more data is available.
+(type = GST_DISCONT_EOS)
+
+GST_EVENT_SEEK
+direction(s): upstream
+event_data: struct {
+              GstSeekType type;
+              gint64 offset;
+              gboolean flush;
+            } seek;
+This event is used if a seek is needed. Uses include applications or the avi demuxer
+element requesting the end of the stream first. The seek can happen absolute (SET),
+relative to the current position (CUR) or relative to the end (END). It is possible
+to seek by frames (FRAME), time in microseconds (TIME) or bytes (BYTE). This is
+indicated by the type field, which takes the values 
+GST_SEEK_FRAME/TIME/BYTEOFFSET_SET/CUR/END. The offset field indicates how many units 
+should be seeked. Negative values indicate seeking backwards from the indicated position.
+The flush field indicates if buffered data shuold be flushed or discarded.
+
+GST_EVENT_FLUSH
+direction(s): upstream
+event_data: none
+This event indicates that all buffered data should be flushed out immediately.
+
+GST_EVENT_INFO
+direction(s): downstream, vertical
+event_data: struct {
+              GstProps *props;
+            } info;
+The Info event is used to transport meta information like bitrate, author, title, 
+interpret or stream length. Most info events will be emitted vertical and downstream
+at the same time. Vertical emission ensures that an application knows about those
+properties and downstream emission ensures that elements can compute own information
+from these infos. (eg converting stream length in bytes to song length in 
+microseconds).
+Props consist of key / value pairs, where the key is a string identifier and the value
+is a GstPropEntry. Many key strings are predefined to allow consistency between elements.
+Elements should try to suppy any information they can as soon as possible.
+
+GST_EVENT_HAS_INFO
+direction(s): upstream
+void (*GstHasInfoCallback) (gchar *name, GstPropsEntry *info, gpointer data);
+event_data: struct {
+              GList *info;
+	      GstHasInfoCallback callback;
+	      gpointer data;
+            } has_info;
+The has_info event might be inserted by an application to find out if a pipeline can supply
+the specified infos. the info list contains all information that the application is 
+interested in. If an element can supply information it calls the supplied callback with the
+name of the information it can supply, the information if it is already available or NULL and
+the data. If this event is destroyed, it will call the callback with name = NULL to indicate
+that no more data will be received.
+This event will for example be used by playlists when they generate information.
+
+GST_EVENT_ERROR
+direction(s): vertical
+event_data: struct {
+              gchar *message
+            } error;
+An error event is emitted, whenever a recoverable error occurs that the application
+should know about. The usage should be similar to GLibs GError. An example would be
+"connection closed" for a host to host plugin.
+
+
+Reference Counting
+------------------
+
+References to events are handled similar to buffers. An element receives an event with
+a single reference. If it forwards the event, this reference is lost.
+Events own a reference to the element that created them. They take care of all of all
+data inside them too (strings, props). So elements and applications that want to keep
+this informations need to copy or add a reference them.
+
+
+Changing Events
+---------------
+It is not allowed to change any data inside an event. Changing events can only be 
+accomplished by removing the reference to them and not forwarding the event and then
+creating a new one.
+
+
+Default Behaviour
+-----------------
+
+* downstream events
+
+  These are not handled by default, because they must be handled by the chain handler
+  of the sink pad. There is however a function called gst_pad_event_default(GstPad *, 
+  GstData *) that will take care of events if your code doesn't want to handle them.
+  But your code must be aware that not everything that your chain function receives
+  is a buffer. It could be an event.
+  
+* upstream events
+
+  Upstream events are handled by a default handler function that is inserted on sink
+  pads when they are created. This function simply forwards the event to all connected
+  sink pads of the element. You are free to change this handler.
+  
+* vertical events
+
+  Vertical events can not be received by elements. Bins have a default handler function
+  that simply forwards the event to their parent. Pipelines offer callbacks for events.
+  You may change this handler for your custom bins.
+  
+  
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+Following are some simple use cases describing how events are generated. The pipeline
+decriptions use gst-launch syntax. "..." indicates that something follows there but is 
+not important for the example.
+
+* filesrc ! fakesink
+ 
+  - When starting the pipeline, filesrc will emit a DISCONTINUOUS event of type NEW 
+    indicating a new stream.
+  - Following that event will be an INFO event containing the length of the file/stream
+    in bytes.
+  - After the file was played, the filesrc emits a "DISCONTINUOUS" of type EOS.
+
+* filesrc ! mad ! ...
+
+  - When starting, filesrc emits a DISCONTINUOUS event followed by an INFO event (see above).
+    The mad plugin remembers the length of the file and removes the INFO element as it
+    is no longer of use. The DISCONTINUOUS event has passed mad after making sure, that all
+    buffers are cleared.
+  - Mad will emit a SEEK event to BYTEOFFSET_END; offset = -sizeof(ID3_info) to read out the ID3 
+    information.
+  - Filesrc emits a DISCONTINUOUS event of type SEEK to indicate that it seeked to the end.
+    This event will not be passed on by mad.
+  - after receiving the ID 3 information, mad will issue an INFO event containing all data
+    it extracted. This event will probably only be passed vertical as ID3 information is of
+    no use to other elements.
+  - mad then ISSUES a SEEK event of type BYTEOFFSET_SET; offset = 0 to make the filesrc start
+    playing the file.
+  - The filesrc will reset its offset and issue a DISCONTINUOUS event of type SEEK. This event
+    will not be forwarded by mad.
+  - When playing starts, mad is able to compute bitrate and other information including playing
+    time with the help of the previous length information supplied by the filesrc. It will then
+    issue another INFO event with that informations. This one will be send downstream and vertical.
+    
+* ... ! avimux ! filesink
+
+  This example is showing a more exotic way of using events. The reader should be aware that AVI
+  files have a limited filesize. Only 4 GB are allowed. We now show what happens when the avimux
+  encoder hits that limit.
+  - When the internal counter of avimux shows that it is approaching the filesize limit, the 
+    avimux element pushes a buffer containig the footer to the filesink.
+  - After that it issues a DISCONTINUOUS event of the type DISCONT_NEW indicating a new stream.
+    The filesink will close the file and reopen a new one.
+  - The avimux plugin resets its internal size counter and restarts sending data to the new file.
+
+* filesrc ! gunzip ! mikmod ! osssink
+
+  (please note that this example is purely theoretical. It should just show ideas)
+  During playback, an application is interested in "interpret", "title", "length_time",
+  "length_size" and "URI" of the current stream. 
+  - The application creates a HAS_INFO event and inserts it at the end of the pipeline into the
+    osssink.
+  - The osssink cannot supply any info so it forwards the event to the mikmod element.
+  - The mikmod element can supply "title" and "length_time". It calls the supplied callback twice
+    and gives these two options. It forwards the event to the gunzip element.
+  - The gunzip element has already decoded the whole data so it knows the size of the stream. It
+    calls the callback for "length_size" and forwards the event.
+  - The filesrc supplies the "URI" and the "length_size" for a second time. It is now up to the
+    application's callback function to handle this second occurence of "length_size" information.
+    The filesrc does not forward the event and dereferences it.
+  - During disposal of the event, the callback function is called again with name=NULL. The
+    application now knows that no "title" can be supplied.  
+  
+  
+Open Questions
+--------------
+
+Open questions are issues that should probably be solved by events but can not be solved
+currently.
+
+* A filesink needs to be able to inform elements of a restricted file size. Simply closing
+  the file and opening a new one might not work because elements might need to supply a 
+  footer. (eg avimux)
+
+
+
+Issues / changes (to be deleted in final version)
+----------------
+
+? Are the event directions distinct? Or is it possible that some type of event
+  can travel eg upstream _and_ vertical?
+? How are upstream/vertical events supposed to be handled if they occur when 
+  the element is READY or NULL? Buffer the event? How many events should be 
+  buffered? Maybe a READY element is attached to a PLAYING/PAUSED one and
+  constantly receiving events, no?
+! The EOS event was merged with the DISCONTINUOUS event.
+? Does the DISCONTINUOUS event need a "flush" option?
+? Should chain funcs be changed to expect GstData instead of GstBuffer?
+  It's a little bit misleading if events can arrive there.
+! added information about timestamp.
+? Should timestamps of "follow up" events (eg conversion of seek) keep the 
+  timestamp?
+? src = NULL, when app inserts event?
+? How do elements handle events they cannot use? (eg filesrc getting timebased 
+  seek request)
+? Somebody fix the GST_EVENT_FLUSH part.
+? GValue or GstProps for INFO events? First requires to open up the props headers
+  and writing some API to ease the retrieval of the elements, the second requires
+  a rewrite of GST_EVENT_INFO.
+? GQuark/GValue possible in INFO events?
+! Merged INFO and PROPS event. They are nearly the same. Added documentation.
+? Need to work out the ERROR event.
+! changed prototype for gst_pad_event_default to accept buffers so the function checks
+  if it is an event and not every chain handler has to.
+! added HAS_INFO event. An alternative to the callback function could be another vertical
+  event.
+? Should HAS_INFO callback supply the element calling the function?
+? Use case one: start with discont event?
+? Do we need a state change event?
+? Should we make elements supply information as soon as possible or only upon HAS_INFO 
+  request?
+? should the second example be done with region requesting instead of events?
+? "location" or "URI"?
+? What about suggesting buffer sizes?
+? What about QoS?

+OUTDATED
+--------
+
+
+Face it, the plugins/ directory hierarchy is crap. We want to propose a
+better layout for it now. Some things to consider:
+
+ - Elements have a klass member in the factory that is used to
+   denote the functional type of the element. For example, the
+   mp3 encoder has a klass of Codec/Encoder/Audio
+   
+ - The plugins can be grouped together by the media type they
+   operate on or by the way they work (decoder/encoder)
+   
+In GStreamer all plugins are techically filters, the only way they
+can be considered sources or sinks (input/output) elements is
+by the absence of src/sink pads. At first sight the source/filter/
+sink distinction is quite useless because most of the plugins
+will go into the filters category anyway. 
+
+We don't want to make the hierarchy too deep, yet provide a 
+clean way to ask for a mp3 decoder element..
+
+Anyway this is a rough proposal to fire off the discussions...

+Internationalization notes
+--------------------------
+- apps:
+  - use setlocale to parse locale env vars and set to language code
+  - use textdomain to set the text domain of their app
+  - use bindtextdomain to tie the domain to a locale dir
+  - use gettext (possibly disguised as _) to translate in the current domain
+
+- libraries:
+  - should only use bindtextdomain to tie a domain to a locale dir
+  - use dgettext (possibly disguised as _) to translate from a set domain
+
+- How to make your plug-in code translateable:
+  - include <gst/gst-i18n-plugin.h> in all files that mark strings for
+    translation, or do the bindtextdomain call
+  - in plugin_init, add a block like this:
+
+#ifdef ENABLE_NLS
+  GST_DEBUG ("binding text domain %s to locale dir %s", GETTEXT_PACKAGE,
+      LOCALEDIR);
+  bindtextdomain (GETTEXT_PACKAGE, LOCALEDIR);
+#endif /* ENABLE_NLS */
+
+  - mark all strings you want translated for translation by wrapping them in
+    _()
+  - typically, these are all strings that serve as the message string for a
+    GST_ELEMENT_ERROR or _WARNING
+  - but it could also consist of any strings that may end up being presented
+    to the user (for example mixer track)
+
+Things to watch out for
+-----------------------
+- forgetting to bindtextdomain is an error that is not always noticeable,
+  because:
+  - any plugin from the same module being init'd binds the text domain,
+    so you may forget it in B, and still have it work because A bound the
+    domain
+  - without a bindtextdomain call, any domain is bound to the system locale
+    dir - so you could still have translations if it happens to be where the
+    translations are
+
+- our translations are managed by the Translation Project
+  http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/translation/
+  They are updated by the release manager for prereleases using
+  make download-po

+INTERFACES & ELEMENTS
+---------------------
+
+1) Introduction
+===============
+Interfaces are descriptions on how to handle an object, without actually
+implementing the object. This allows for multiple objects to be instantiated
+based on this interface. Each of them can then be handled equally by an
+application.
+Glib, apparently (unchecked), has a way of creating interfaces, probably
+by means of a class struct without actually defining the object. The object,
+then, does not define a class and these two add up. Benjamin knows more
+about interfaces, I didn't study interfaces & glib too deeply, yet. I know
+them just from Java.
+Interfaces are cool! It allows for some sort of random element creation
+without needing to link to the implementation. This is similar to how
+GStreamer currently handles media plugins. GStreamer itself could be seen
+as an interface too, in that respect.
+
+2) So why do we need interfaces?
+================================
+Because GStreamer doesn't handle it all. GStreamer in itself is a media
+framework for streams of data from one element to the next. There's lots
+of things that's media-related, but not handled in this description.
+Several examples will probably clarify this: think of the Xvideo output
+plugin. We can create an overlay here (Xv-based), and we currently control
+this X-connection using glib properties. However, what property name is
+associated with what control? And does it work the same as v4lsrc's
+overlay image control?
+The same goes for a mixer, for image control, audio control, and probably
+a lot more. The general idea is simple: *this needs to be documented*.
+But properties aren't all - they simply cannot do this all. Some things
+cannot be described in a simple one-argument property thing. Of course,
+we could give a pointer to a struct as argument, but that's merely a hack
+and requires both plugin and app to know the ABI of the struct. This
+kills the whole idea of making the plugin independent of the app.
+In short: we want interfaces for this.
+
+3) How to integrate an interface in GStreamer
+=============================================
+Let us start with some starting point: an interface is associated
+with an element. It is a feature exported by that specific element,
+not by a pipeline or anything more complex. Pipelines are already
+handled just fine by GStreamer (or you wouldn't be reading all
+this).
+Obviously, a pipeline can be a fallback for an interface. Imagine
+that we're looking for an audio sink that exposes a mixer, but our
+fakesink audio output doesn't ("I wonder why"). We could then create
+a pipeline with the volume element in it to "fake" a mixer. Ideally,
+the volume element would implement a mixer interface itself.
+
+How are we going to do that in programmatic way? We currently use
+properties. Their huge advantage is that we do not need to care
+about adding new functions or whatever. Their disadvantage is that
+they're limited to one argument. Anything more complex requires
+app/plugin knowledge about the shared data, and that defeats the
+point of them: to have no dependency on each other. This could be
+solved partially by using action signals, but that makes the whole
+picture quite complex (since you use multiple methods for doing one
+simple thing). Also, they are quite slow compared to functions
+because of the table lookups. In short: it'd work, but I'm not in
+facour of it...
+OK, so an element exposes interfaces. This allows us to think of
+the idea of embedding interfaces (dynamically, of course) in the
+GstElement object. Think of an object being able to register an
+indefinate number of interfaces per object instance, and a client
+application could then enumerate interfaces and instantiate one.
+Glib gives us GInterface for this purpose. The disadvantage of
+this is that it's on a per-class basis, not a per-instance basis.
+This is a problem in case of elements where it depends on several
+properties whether it supports an interface or not. This can be
+solved by simply making one generic virtual function "supported ()"
+in a generic derived object of GInterface (GstInterface?).
+
+GstInterface is then a generic thing that is inherited by specific
+interfaces (see examples). Obviously, the client will need to know
+about the ABI/API of this struct, but that'll happen either way.
+Surely, there needs to binary linkage, but I don't consider that a
+bad thing. It does improve performance compared to action signals!
+
+So an element contains interfaces. But where are these interfaces
+described? And who creates them? I suggest that we do that just as
+we handle gstvideo and gstaudio right now (these libs do *nothing*
+useful currently, so this'd make them a lot more interesting).
+These interfaces inherit from GstInterface. The functions that
+are needed, can be provided through a class object. The element is
+then responsible for storing variables and so on. gstvideo/audio
+provides wrapper functions for the class functions. That's also how
+glib suggest us to use GInterfaces.
+
+Plugin and application then handle and retrieve interfaces as
+documented in the glib documentation, which is available at:
+http://www.gnome.org/~mathieu/gobject/main.html
+
+So the most important part left is to document the interfaces
+and make sure all elements exporting them work equally. For this,
+I'll give two examples.
+
+4) Examples
+===========
+
+/* This small extra virtual function is here to provide an
+ * interface functionality on a per-instance basis rather
+ * than a per-class basis, which is the case for glib.
+ */
+typedef struct _GstInterfaceClass {
+  GTypeInterface parent;
+
+  /* virtual functions */
+  gboolean (* supported) (GstInterface *iface);
+} GstInterfaceClass;
+
+There would probably be a convenience function that checks
+a specific interface's implementation (glib allows for this)
+and checks for ->supported () to be set and to return TRUE:
+
+gboolean
+gst_element_implements_interface (GstElement *element,
+				  GType       iface_type)
+{
+  if (G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE_TYPE (G_OBJECT (element),
+				  type)) {
+    GstInterface *iface;
+    GstInterfaceClass *ifclass;
+
+    iface = G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE_CAST (G_OBJECT (element),
+					type, GstInterface)
+    ifclass = GST_INTERFACE_GET_CLASS (iface);
+
+    if (ifclass->supported != NULL &&
+        ifclass->supported (iface) == TRUE) {
+      return TRUE;
+    }
+  }
+
+  return FALSE;
+}
+
+Let's now add some functions so we can abuse this in case/check
+functions.
+
+GstInterface *
+gst_interface_cast (gpointer from,
+		    GType    type)
+{
+  GstInterface *iface;
+
+  /* check cast, give warning+fail if it's invalid */
+  if (!(iface = G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE_CAST (G_OBJECT (element),
+					    type, GstInterface))) {
+    return NULL;
+  }
+
+  /* if we're an element, take care that this interface
+   * is actually implemented */
+  if (GST_IS_ELEMENT (from)) {
+    gboolean interface_is_implemented =
+	gst_element_implements_interface (GST_ELEMENT (from),
+					  type);
+    g_return_val_if_fail (interface_is_implemented == TRUE, NULL);
+  }
+
+  return iface;
+}
+
+gboolean
+gst_interface_check (gpointer from,
+		     GType    type)
+{
+  GstInterface *iface;
+
+  /* check cast, return FALSE if it fails, don't give a warning... */
+  if (!G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE_CAST (from, type,
+				   GstInterface)) {
+    return FALSE;
+  }
+
+  iface = G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE_CAST (G_OBJECT (element),
+				      type, GstInterface);
+
+  /* now, if we're an element (or derivative), is this thing
+   * actually implemented for real? */
+  if (GST_IS_ELEMENT (from)) {
+    if (!gst_element_implements_interface (GST_ELEMENT (from),
+					   type)) {
+      return FALSE;
+    }
+  }
+
+  return TRUE;
+}
+
+#define GST_INTERFACE_CHECK_INSTANCE_CAST(obj, type, cast_t) \
+  ((cast_t *) gst_interface_cast ((obj), (type))
+#define GST_INTERFACE_CHECK_INSTANCE_TYPE(obj, type) \
+  (gst_interface_check ((obj), (type))
+
+We could use this in the GST_IS_... () macros. For example, the
+macros GST_IS_MIXER () and GST_MIXER () would then look like this:
+
+/* Note that this is a non-standard macro, and with a reason! */
+#define GST_MIXER(obj) \
+  (GST_INTERFACE_CHECK_INSTANCE_CAST ((obj), \
+				      GST_TYPE_MIXER,
+				      GstMixer))
+#define GST_IS_MIXER(obj) \
+  (GST_INTERFACE_CHECK_INSTANCE_TYPE ((obj), \
+				      GST_TYPE_MIXER))
+
+So the application would just tread it with the known macro, and
+everything would look extremely simple to the end user.
+
+4a) mixer
+---------
+A mixer is a way of controlling volume and input/output channels.
+This doesn't mean that you control which channel is the subwoofer,
+all that is supposed to be done automatically. It is really meant
+as a way of representing system-level volumes and such. It could
+also be used to turn on/off certain outputs or inputs.
+As you've noticed, I'm not only talking about output, but also
+input. Indeed, I want both osssrc *and* osssink to export the
+same mixer interface! Or at least a very similar one. Volume
+control works the same for both. You could say that osssrc should
+enumerate the input channels (such as microphone, line-in). Of
+course, osssink should not. Or maybe it should, not sure... Maybe,
+we'd need a parent osselement which implements all mixer channels.
+And alsa* would surely implement the same interface.
+
+/* This is confusing naming... (i.e. FIXME)
+ * A channel is referred to both as the number of simultaneous
+ * sound streams the input can handle as well as the in-/output
+ * itself
+ */
+
+#define GST_MIXER_CHANNEL_INPUT  (1<<0)
+#define GST_MIXER_CHANNEL_OUTPUT (1<<1)
+#define GST_MIXER_CHANNEL_MUTE   (1<<2)
+#define GST_MIXER_CHANNEL_RECORD (1<<3)
+
+typedef struct _GstMixerChannel {
+  gchar *label;
+  gint   current_num_channels,
+         max_num_channels,
+         flags;
+} GstMixerChannel;
+
+typedef struct _GstMixerClass {
+  GTypeInterface klass;
+
+  /* virtual functions */
+  GList *  (* list_channels) (GstMixer        *mixer);
+
+  void     (* set_volume)    (GstMixer        *mixer,
+			      GstMixerChannel *channel,
+			      gint            *volumes);
+  void     (* get_volume)    (GstMixer        *mixer,
+			      GstMixerChannel *channel,
+			      gint            *volumes);
+
+  void     (* set_mute)      (GstMixer        *mixer,
+			      GstMixerChannel *channel,
+			      gboolean         mute);
+  void     (* set_record)    (GstMixer        *mixer,
+			      GstMixerChannel *channel,
+			      gboolean         record);
+} GstMixerClass;
+
+libgstmixer.la/so provides wrapper functions for each of the
+class' virtual functions. Possibly also some macros for
+GST_MIXER_CHANNEL_HAS_FLAG () or _get_channel ().
+
+The rest is done automatically, as described in the already-
+mentioned glib documentation for GInterface. This includes
+things like the base_init () function of the GstMixerClass,
+which fills all the virtual functions for the mixer, and the
+actual function implementations. The mixer, basically, operates
+as an element on its own. It gets the file descriptor from
+the interface->element (every oss... is a osscommon, etc.).
+
+4b) overlay
+-----------
+Overlay is used in both in- and output, too. Think of v4lsrc,
+v4l2src, v4lmjpegsrc, xvideosink - all overlays. But where do
+we position the overlay window? Control of this can be done at
+various levels: locational control (over the server, asynchronous)
+or XID control (but that makes you depend on X and limits the
+ability to broaden it over to non-X elements such as fbsink).
+
+However, simplicity *is* an issue here. Do we really care about
+overlay? In the end, users will have to link against either FB
+or X anyway, so we might want to create separate interfaces for
+both. On the other hand, we want to be general too... This is a
+decision that we need to make as early as possible in this process.
+For now, I propose making X- and FB-based interfaces.
+
+Let's assume that we take X as a basis. Then, overlay becomes as
+simple as one function. Possible extendible by providing inputs
+(like in the mixer) and norms, although that only applies to
+input-to-analog, not to-digital... Others simply return NULL.
+
+typedef struct _GstOverlayClass {
+  GTypeInterface klass;
+
+  /* virtual functions */
+  void    (* set_xwindowid) (GstOverlay        *overlay,
+			     XID                xid);
+} GstOverlayClass;
+
+That's all! It would look similar for FB & co.
+
+4c) user input
+--------------
+And yes, user input could be an interface too. Even better, it
+should definately be. And wasn't this one of our key issues for
+0.8.0?
+
+No code here. Go implement it, lazy ass!
+
+General ways of thinking: input can come from a plugin, or from
+the application (we don't have modules for joystick input et all).
+However, plugins handling input (such as dvdsrc) need to be able
+to handle each. So we get both input-to-application as well as
+input-from-application APIs.
+
+5) Status of this document
+==========================
+The interfaces are implemented, more (for metadata, framebuffer-
+overlay, video balancing (brightness), user input etc. are all
+pending.

+GNOME Streamer is a pipeline-based media streaming framework.  It is built

+
+A pipeline consists of at one or more each of sources, sinks, and filters.
+These elements may be combined inside container elements, which may have
+their own specific properties, and act as any other element.  Each element 
+has one or more pads, which are connection points.  These pads are

+
+Operation of the pipeline is fully automatic once a buffer is put in the

+- GStreamer Scheduling / Synchronization (incsched) Notes -

+
+I.   Miscelaneous proposals
+II.  Liveness problems (sometimes deadlock ;) and propsed solutions
+III. State transition approach and responsibility
+
+MattH.
+
+--------------------------------
+-   I. Miscalenous proposals   -
+--------------------------------
+
+1. Change the names of GstThread and GstQueue to GstPtThread and GstPtQueue
+   for pthread versions of Thread and Queue.
+
+2. Change GstPtQueue to check its pads' peers' managers and make sure
+   they are different.  If not, fail and generate error message.  (This
+   ensures a GstPtQueue straddles a pthread boundary.)
+
+3. Change state transitions to NULL <-> READY <-> PAUSED <-> PLAYING.
+
+
+---------------------------------------------------
+-  II. Deadlock Scenarios and Proposed Solutions  -
+-      (in the order they will be implemented)    -
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+1. A downstream element "waits" for a buffer from its upstream element,
+   a state change happens and "pauses" the upstream element -- the
+   downstream element is blocked and cannot execute its change_state.
+
+   Note that this can only happen within a single GstPtQueue!  Either a
+   downstream element calls Pull, finds no buffer, and does a
+   wait_cond(new buffer) or an upstream element calls Push, finds no
+   room, and does a wait_cond(new room).  Thus, GstPtQueue contains all
+   the cond_wait / signal code. 
+ 
+   => The managing container (thread, pipeline) "wakes" up any sleep
+      conditions of its "bottom half".  (In the scenario described, it
+      wakes the blocked downstream element's call to Pull.)  The GstPtQueue
+      cond_wait section determines that it woke up due to a pending state
+      change and does a cothread_switch(0) to return to the main loop,
+      which then executes the state transition.
+
+      Note that a managing container will have only one sleep condition
+      in its "bottom half." 
+
+
+2. Element "blocked" on getting I/O and cannot execute its change_state.
+
+   => We will provide an I/O library for the elements to use that does
+      not actually block.  (A retry-loop with timeout or select() on
+      2 -- or more -- file descriptors: one the one you want I/O from, 
+      the other one that GStreamer uses to "wake" everyone up.)  The
+      I/O library determines that it was woken due to a pending state
+      change and does a cothread_switch(0) to return to the main loop,
+      which then executes the state transition.
+
+      Note that a managing container will have only one elements in
+      the middle of doing blocking I/O.
+
+
+3. Element using a library (code out of its control) which blocks for
+   some reason (e.g., using real blocking I/O) so main loop never gets
+   run to execute change_state.
+
+   => Build in some timeout in the manging container (the "top half")
+      when waiting for bottom half to respond to pending state.  If
+      managing container times out, kill the element's thread with a
+      signal (or series of signals -- escalating priority).  This
+      requires that the element (the "bottom half") have matching
+      signal handler(s) that execute(s) the state-transition.
+
+
+--------------------------------------------------------
+- III.  State-transition Approach and Responsibility   -
+--------------------------------------------------------
+
+A. The "top half" context of the managing container.  (This is likely the
+   context of the application.)
+
+   Call change_state on the managing container (GstPipeline, GstPtThread).
+   If its "bottom half" (main_loop) is asleep, signal the condition to
+   wake it up.  Then do a cond_wait for the "bottom half" to execute the
+   state transition and return (once the state has been changed).
+
+ 
+B. The main_loop (the "bottom half") of the managing container. 
+
+   Needs to check for pending state transition after every switch back from
+   one of its elements.  If a pending state is found, it calls change_state
+   on each of its elements, signals the "top half" that the state has been
+   changed, then continues executing the plan (if Playing) or puts itself
+   to sleep (Paused, Ready).
+
+
+C. Element.
+
+   Implement a change_state function to make transition for that element.
+   The elements' change_state is what actually changes the state variable
+   and notifies the scheduler that the state was changed.  This function
+   may also do things like close or open resources.
+   
+   NOTE: when an element goes through certain state transitions (e.g., from
+   Paused to Ready) its state (stack) will be wiped out.  If it wants to
+   preserve any state or data, it needs to store the information in a safe
+   place.
+
+
+D. Cothread Scheduler.
+
+   Gets notified of state transition by elements' change_state functions
+   then (re)set the plan accordingly.  Assuming
+   NULL <-> READY <-> PAUSED <-> PLAYING, some would be
+
+   + Paused -> Playing: jump back where you were in the Plan and continue
+                        its execution
+
+   + Ready -> Paused: reset the cothread pointers foreach cothread in the 
+                      Plan (don't run)

+OUTDATED
+--------
+
+The point of the metadata is to provide some context for each buffer.  In
+the case of audio data, for instance, it would provide the samplerate, bit
+depth, and channel count.
+
+The trick is that there may be multiple types of metadata ganged onto a
+single buffer.  This is why they're going to be a GList.  This does mean
+extra overhead in all cases, but I think it's minimal.  The GList type
+uses a chunk allocater so we're not wasting too much memory or time when
+adding to the list.
+
+The trick is dealing with these structs as they pass through a pipeline,
+since they have potentially different mutability properties.  For
+instance, if you've got a mp3 decoder connected to a tee, which sends the
+buffers off to both the decoder and a spectrum analyzer (and then a
+visualization element).  The preferred setup would be where every time a
+audio/raw metadata comes down the pipe (indicating a potential change in
+audio format), the audiosink and spectrum would just save off pointers.
+
+So when exactly does this metadata go away (deallocated)?  Well, that
+means metadata has to be refcounted.  But that gets rather hairy.  OK, in
+the simple case you create a metadata struct, it comes with refcount set
+to 1.  You pass it through, it stays one, eventually someone drops the
+last reference on the buffer it's tied to, you free the metadata too.
+Easy.  What if you tee?  You could go through and for every metadata in
+the buffer, increment the refcount by the same as the buffer.  So in the
+above case (tee'd), the audiosink and spectrum would get the buffer with a
+refcount of 2, and it'd have a metadata with refcount 2.  Do they ref it
+each themselves, then unref the buffer?  Or do they remove the metadata?
+Removing the metadata would require a buffer CoW, which would suck, so
+yes, they'd just ref the metadata.
+
+But....  what if they're all in different threads?  Then we're off into
+the magical world of mutexes.  Everything with a refcount in a threaded
+world must be mutexed, else you can do atomic increment and atomic
+dec&test.  Can this be done from C easily?  Perhaps it needs to be found
+from kernel includes via autoconf?
+
+
+
+
+The goal in designing the way metadata will be defined and used is to keep
+it as simple as possible.  The basis for accomplishing this is the fact
+that in order to actually use (rather than just pass) the metadata, you
+have to know what the fields are, which means you have to have compiled in
+support for that metadata at build time.  Therefore, if you're using
+metadata, you must have build-time access to the necessary include file
+that defines it.
+
+So, given that you've got an include file, it would be nice if the whole
+thing could be contained there.  This would limit the need to be linked
+against something, or have load-time requirements as to that has to be
+loaded before you are.
+
+Given that really all metadata is is a region of memory of a given size
+with a certain signature, this isn't all that hard.  First you lay out the
+struct that defines the metadata.  Then you set up #defines that expand to
+the size of the struct in question, as well as the four-cc code that
+defines the type.
+
+The work is done by a few #defines, a la the #defines used in all Gtk
+objects.  The first is a NEW() method that allocates the memory for the
+metadata and fills in all the normal fields (type, size, utility
+functions).  Because of the way it's defined (as a #define, no less),
+you'll have to invoke it as META_NEW(meta), since it can't return()
+anything.
+
+Another #define will check to make sure a meta is indeed that type by
+verifying the type code and size.  Theoretically, meta types can overlap
+with the same fourcc code, as long as they have different sizes.  But I
+probably ought to have a global public registry so people writing things
+don't conflict.  MSFT got that right, at least.
+
+So, a hairy problem is what to do when there are utility functions
+associated with one of these things.  One option is to not bother with
+them.  This is very likely a possible solution, since metadata is supposed
+to be flat memory of a given size.  Not much to do to either free or copy
+it, is there?

+MIME types in GStreamer
+
+What is a MIME type ?
+=====================
+
+A MIME type is a combination of two (short) strings (words)---the content type
+and the content subtype. Content types are broad categories used for describing
+almost all types of files: video, audio, text, and application are common
+content types. The subtype further breaks the content type down into a more
+specific type description, for example 'application/ogg', 'audio/raw',
+'video/mpeg', or 'text/plain'.
+
+So the content type and subtype make up a pair that describes the type of
+information contained in a file. In multimedia processing, MIME types are used
+to describe the type of information carried by a media stream. In GStreamer, we
+use MIME types in the same way, to identify the types of information that are
+allowed to pass between GStreamer elements. The MIME type is part of a GstCaps
+object that describes a media stream. Besides a MIME type, a GstCaps object also
+contains a name and some stream properties (GstProps, which hold combinations of
+key/value pairs).
+
+An example of a MIME type is 'video/mpeg'. A corresponding GstCaps could be
+created using code:
+
+GstCaps *caps = gst_caps_new_simple ("video/mpeg",
+				     "width",  G_TYPE_INT, 384,
+				     "height", G_TYPE_INT, 288,
+				     NULL);
+
+MIME types and their corresponding properties are of major importance in
+GStreamer for uniquely identifying media streams. Therefore, we define them
+per media type. All GStreamer plugins should keep to this definition.
+
+Official MIME media types are assigned by the IANA. Current assignments are at
+http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/.
+
+The problems
+============
+
+Some streams may have MIME types or GstCaps that do not fully describe the
+stream. In most cases, this is not a problem, though. For example, if a stream
+contains Ogg/Vorbis data (which is of type 'application/ogg'), we don't need to
+know the samplerate of the raw audio stream, since we can't play the encoded
+audio anyway. The samplerate is, however, important for raw audio, so a decoder
+would need to retrieve the samplerate from the Ogg/Vorbis stream headers (the
+headers are part of the bytestream) in order to pass it on in the GstCaps that
+belongs to the decoded audio (which becomes a type like 'audio/raw'). However,
+other plugins might want to know such properties, even for compressed streams.
+One such example is an AVI muxer, which does want to know the samplerate of an
+audio stream, even when it is compressed.
+
+Another problem is that many media types can be defined in multiple ways. For
+example, MJPEG video can be defined as 'video/jpeg', 'video/mjpeg',
+'image/jpeg', 'video/x-msvideo' with a compression of (fourcc) MJPG, etc.
+None of these is really official, since there isn't an official mimetype
+for encoded MJPEG video.
+
+The main focus of this document is to propose a standardized set of MIME types
+and properties that will be used by the GStreamer plugins.
+
+Different types of streams
+==========================
+
+There are several types of media streams. The most important distinction will be
+container formats, audio codecs and video codecs. Container formats are
+bytestreams that contain one or more substreams inside it, and don't provide any
+direct media data itself. Examples are Quicktime, AVI or MPEG System Stream.
+They mostly contain of a set of headers that define the media streams that are
+packed inside the container, along with the media data itself.
+
+Video codecs and audio codecs describe encoded audio or video data. Examples are
+MPEG-1 video, DivX video, MPEG-1 layer 3 (MP3) audio or Ogg/Vorbis audio.
+Actually, Ogg is a container format too (for Vorbis audio), but these are
+usually used in conjunction with each other.
+
+Finally, there are the somewhat obvious (but not commonly encountered as files)
+raw data formats.

+(take mp3 vs. sid, etc.). This is just a per-case thing right now and needs to
+be documented further.

+Raw formats
+-----------
+
+Raw formats contain unencoded, raw media information. These are rather rare from
+an end user point of view since raw media files have historically been
+prohibitively large ... hence the multitude of encoding formats.
+
+Raw video formats require the following common properties, in addition to
+format-specific properties:
+
+width = 1 - MAXINT (INT)
+height = 1 - MAXINT (INT)
+
+1 - Raw Video (YUV/YCbCr)
+    MIME type: video/x-raw-yuv
+    Properties: 'format' = 'XXXX' (fourcc)
+    Known fourccs: YUY2, I420, Y41P, YVYU, UYVY, etc.
+    Properties:
+
+    Some raw video formats have implicit alignment rules. We should discuss this
+    more. Also, some formats have multiple fourccs (e.g. IYUV/I420 or
+    YUY2/YUYV). For each of these, we only use one (e.g. I420 and YUY2).
+
+    Currently recognized formats:
+
+    YUY2: packed, Y-U-Y-V order, U/V hor 2x subsampled (YUV-4:2:2, 16 bpp)
+    YVYU: packed, Y-V-Y-U order, U/V hor 2x subsampled (YUV-4:2:2, 16 bpp)
+    UYVY: packed, U-Y-V-Y order, U/V hor 2x subsampled (YUV-4:2:2, 16 bpp)
+    Y41P: packed, UYVYUYVYYYYY order, U/V hor 4x subsampled (YUV-4:1:1, 12 bpp)
+    IUY2: packed, U-Y-V order, not subsampled (YUV-1:1:1, 24 bpp)
+
+    Y42B: planar, Y-U-V order, U/V hor 2x subsampled (YUV-4:2:2, 16 bpp)
+    YV12: planar, Y-V-U order, U/V hor+ver 2x subsampled (YUV-4:2:0, 12 bpp)
+    I420: planar, Y-U-V order, U/V hor+ver 2x subsampled (YUV-4:2:0, 12 bpp)
+    Y41B: planar, Y-U-V order, U/V hor 4x subsampled (YUV-4:1:1, 12bpp)
+    YUV9: planar, Y-U-V order, U/V hor+ver 4x subsampled (YUV-4:1:0, 9bpp)
+    YVU9: planar, Y-V-U order, U/V hor+ver 4x subsampled (YUV-4:1:0, 9bpp)
+
+    Y800: one-plane (Y-only, YUV-4:0:0, 8bpp)
+
+    See http://www.fourcc.org/ for more information.
+
+    Note: YUV-4:4:4 (both planar and packed, in multiple orders) are missing.

+    24 and 32 bit RGB should always be specified as big endian, since any little
+    endian format can be transformed into big endian by rearranging the color
+    masks. 15 and 16 bit formats should generally have the same byte order as
+    the CPU.
+
+    Color masks are interpreted by loading 'bpp' number of bits using the given
+    'endianness', and masking and shifting by each color mask. Loading a 24-bit
+    value cannot be done directly, but one can perform an equivalent operation.
+
+    Examples:
+               msb .. lsb
+      - memory: RRRRRRRR GGGGGGGG BBBBBBBB RRRRRRRR GGGGGGGG ...
+                bpp        = 24
+                depth      = 24
+                endianness = 4321 (G_BIG_ENDIAN)
+                red_mask   = 0xff0000
+                green_mask = 0x00ff00
+                blue_mask  = 0x0000ff
+
+      - memory: xRRRRRGG GGGBBBBB xRRRRRGG GGGBBBBB xRRRRRGG ...
+                bpp        = 16
+                depth      = 15
+                endianness = 4321 (G_BIG_ENDIAN)
+                red_mask   = 0x7c00
+                green_mask = 0x03e0
+                blue_mask  = 0x003f
+
+      - memory: GGGBBBBB xRRRRRGG GGGBBBBB xRRRRRGG GGGBBBBB ...
+                bpp        = 16
+                depth      = 15
+                endianness = 1234 (G_LITTLE_ENDIAN)
+                red_mask   = 0x7c00
+                green_mask = 0x03e0
+                blue_mask  = 0x003f
+
+The raw audio formats require the following common properties, in addition to
+format-specific properties:
+
+rate = 1 - MAXINT (INT, sampling rate)
+channels = 1 - MAXINT (INT, number of audio channels)
+endianness = 1234/4321 (INT) <- use G_LITTLE_ENDIAN/G_BIG_ENDIAN/G_BYTE_ORDER
+
+3 - Raw audio (integer format)
+    MIME type: audio/x-raw-int
+    properties: width = 8/16/24/32 (INT, bits used to store each sample)
+                depth = 8 - 32 (INT, bits actually used per sample)
+                signed = TRUE/FALSE (BOOLEAN)
+
+4 - Raw audio (floating point format)
+    MIME type: audio/x-raw-float
+    Properties: width = 32/64 (INT)
+                buffer-frames: number of audio frames per buffer, 0=undefined
+
+Plugin Guidelines
+=================
+
+So, a short bit on what plugins should do. Above, I've stated that audio
+properties like 'channels' and 'rate' or video properties like 'width' and
+'height' are all optional. This doesn't mean you can just simply omit them and
+everything will still work!
+
+An example is the best way to explain all this. AVI needs the width, height,
+rate and channels for the AVI header. So if these properties are missing, the
+avimux element cannot properly create the AVI header. On the other hand, MPEG
+doesn't have such properties in its header, so the mpegdemux element would need
+to parse the separate streams in order to find them out. We don't want that
+either, because a plugin only does one job. So normally, mpegdemux and avimux
+wouldn't allow transcoding. To solve this problem, there are stream parser
+elements (such as mpegaudioparse, ac3parse and mpeg1videoparse).
+
+Conclusions to draw from here: a plugin gives info it can provide as seen from
+its own task/job. If it can't, other elements might still need it and a stream
+parser needs to be written if it doesn't already exist.
+
+On properties that can be described by one of these (properties such as 'width',
+'height', 'fps', etc.): they're forbidden and should be handled using filtered
+caps.
+
+Status of this document
+=======================
+
+Not all plugins strictly follow these guidelines yet, but these are the official
+types. Plugins not following these specs either use extensions that should be
+documented, or are buggy (and should be fixed).

+Moving around plug-ins between source modules
+---------------------------------------------
+
+Last updated: 2006-09-01
+
+How to get your plug-in out of -bad and into -good or -ugly
+-----------------------------------------------------------
+
+Since GStreamer 0.9.x, we have four plugin modules: -base, -good, -ugly,
+and -bad.  Plug-ins are by default added to -bad.  They can only move
+to -good or -ugly if a number of conditions are met:
+
+PEOPLE
+------
+- People involved:
+  - There should be a person who is actively going to maintain this element;
+    presumably this is the person writing the plug-in in the first place
+    and opening the move request
+  - There should be a GStreamer hacker who is willing to sponsor the element;
+    this would be someone who is going to help out getting all the conditions
+    met, act as a mentor if necessary,...
+  - There should be a core developer who verifies that the checklist is
+    met
+
+  The three roles can be filled by two people, but not just one.
+
+  In addition, an admin needs to perform the actual move, which involves
+  CVS surgery.
+
+PROCESS
+-------
+- bug in bugzilla gets filed by someone requesting a move from bad
+  to good/ugly
+  This is "requesting" the move.
+- a second person reviews the request and code, and verifies that the
+  plugin meets the checklist items below, by commenting on the bug
+  and giving a rundown of what still needs to be done
+  This is "sponsoring" the move.
+- when the checklist is met, a third person can approve the move.
+  This is "approving" the move.
+- an admin performs the move.
+  This is "performing" the move.  (Are you laughing yet ?)
+
+CHECKLIST
+---------
+- The plug-in's code:
+  - should descend from an applicable base class if possible
+  - make use of GST_BOILERPLATE macros
+  - conform to the GStreamer coding style
+  - use a custom debug category
+  - use GST_(DEBUG/*)_OBJECT
+  - use dashes in object property names to separate words
+  - use correct value, name, nick for enums
+  - use underscores in macros/function names/structs
+    e.g.: GST_BASE_SINK, GstBaseSink, gst_base_sink_
+  - use g_assert(), g_return_if_fail(), g_return_val_if_fail() for pre/post
+    condition checks
+  - must not have any functional code within g_assert(), g_return_if_fail() or
+    g_return_val_if_fail() statements, since those would be turned into NO-OPS
+    if the code is compiled with -DG_DISABLE_CHECKS (as is often done on
+    embedded systems).
+
+- The plug-in's build:
+  - should be correctly integrated with configure.ac
+  - files implementing elements should be named according to their class name,
+    e.g GstBaseSink -> gstbasesink.c
+  - should list libs and cflags in stack order, with lowest in the stack first
+    (so one can link against highest in the stack somewhere else without
+     picking up everything from the somewhere else)
+    e.g. $(GST_PLUGINS_BASE_CFLAGS) \
+         $(GST_BASE_CFLAGS) \
+         $(GST_CFLAGS) $(CAIRO_CFLAGS)
+
+- The compiled plug-in:
+  - should show up correct in gst-inspect output; no warnings, no unknown
+    types, ...
+
+- The plug-in should be put in the correct location inside the module:
+  sys/: plug-ins that include system headers/link to system libraries;
+    usually platform-dependent as well
+    name after whatever system "thing" they use (oss, v4l, ...)
+  gst/: plug-ins with no external dependencies, only GLib/GStreamer/liboil
+  ext/: plug-ins with external dependencies
+
+- The plug-in is documented:
+  - the compiled-in descriptions (element details) should be correct
+  - every element in the plug-in should have gtk-doc documentation:
+    - longer description of element
+    - why you would use this element
+    - example launch line OR example source code
+      (for example, see
+       http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-audiotestsrc.html
+       for the first and
+       http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-good-plugins/html/gst-plugins-good-plugins-level.html
+       for the second)
+    - if the element has custom messages, they should be documented
+    - signals and properties should be documented
+
+- The plug-in should come with tests:
+  - preferably, a unit test should be written, testing things like:
+    - setup and teardown
+    - push in buffers in all supported formats and verify they are handled
+      properly
+    - push in buffers that trigger error cases, and verify errors are
+      correctly thrown
+
+    for example, see gst-plugins-base/check/elements/audioconvert
+
+    The unit test should be put in check/elements/(nameofelement)
+    and be added to check_PROGRAMS and Makefile.am
+
+  - if a unit test is not appropriate (for example, device elements),
+    a test application should be written that can be run manually
+
+- The tests should be leak-free, tested with valgrind
+  - the unit tests in check/ dirs are valgrinded by default
+  - the manual tests should have a valgrind target
+  - leaks in the supporting library (and verified to be in the supporting
+    library !) can be added to suppression files
+
+- The elements should not segfault under any circumstance.  This includes:
+  - wrong pipelines
+  - bad data
+
+- The plugins need to be marked correctly for translations.
+- All error conditions should be correctly handled using GST_ELEMENT_ERROR
+  and following practice outlined in
+  http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstGError.html
+  - this includes:
+    - message strings need to be marked for translation
+    - should be short, well-written, clear
+    - in particular, should *not* contain debug info, strerror, errno, ...
+      No, really ! NO STRERROR, NO ERRNO.  If you are too lazy to provide
+      the user of your library with a nice experience, put your crap in
+      the debug string
+
+- Decision should be made if it should go into good (LGPL license,
+  LGPL dependencies, no patent issues) or ugly
+
+- plugin documentation needs to be added:
+  - see gstreamer/docs/README; section on adding plugins and elements
+  - "make update" in docs/plugins and commit the new file
+  - edit -docs.sgml and add an include for the file

+Mutability is the property of an object that defines whether or not you
+are allowed to modify it.  In the context of GST, that means that if you
+want to mutilate a buffer, say to do an audio effect, you may have to do
+this on a copy of the buffer, if someone else has a reference on it.
+
+The simplest sequence of events in a decoder pipeline is as follows:

+2) allocate and fill data region, attach to buffer
+3) pass to next element
+4) decode the data into new buffer, free original buffer
+5) pass to next element
+6) buffer gets copied to output device (sound, video, whatever)

+Both of these buffers are created from malloc()'d memory, are referenced

+They have no special flags, and when ref==0, they're simply free()'d.

+An optimization in the case of the sound card or video double buffering,
+where the output buffer actually comes from the output device.  In that

+
+A more complex example is where the data is teed after being decoded, sent

+1) create buffer, fill from source
+2) hand to decoder
+3) create new buffer, decode into it, free old buffer

+
+Some notes on pad negotiation
+
+
+A "pad link" is a connection between two pads.  It can be in one of
+two states, "negotiated" or "not negotiated".  Pad links are created
+by gst_pad_link().
+
+A "pad link" is created when two pads are linked using gst_pad_link().
+When initially created, the link only specifies a src pad, a sink pad,
+and optionally a filter caps provided by the application.
+
+In order to pass data through a link, the peer pads must decide on
+what data format to use.  This is called negotiation.  Pads
+describe acceptable data formats by using a combination of  pad
+template caps and (optionally) a pad->getcaps function.
+
+
+Negotiation can happen in one of two forms, directed or undirected.
+Directed negotiation happens when one element has decided (usually
+during negotiation on another pad) to ask for a specific format on
+a pad.  This happens when a pad calls gst_pad_try_set_caps().
+Undirected negotiation happens when the core decides to negotiate
+a link, either due to a state change or a specific application
+request.
+
+Steps in undirected negotiation (core view):
+
+ - core checks that both pad's parent elements are in the READY or
+   higher state.
+
+ - core calls gst_pad_get_caps() on each pad, intersects the two caps,
+   and intersects again with the filter caps.  If the intersection is
+   empty, then the pads have no formats in common, and the link fails.
+
+ - If the intersection caps is not fixed, there are multiple possible
+   formats that the link could use.  If this is the case, fixate
+   functions are called until the caps are fixed.  The fixate functions
+   are called by priority -- src application fixate function, sink
+   application fixate function, src and sink fixate functions, and
+   the default core fixate function.  The application fixate functions
+   are implemented by the "fixate" signal on each pad.  The core
+   loops through the fixate functions until a fixed caps is decided
+   on.
+
+ - Each pad may have a pad_link function, which is called with the
+   fixed caps.  The pad_link function has the option of accepting,
+   rejecting, or delaying the negotiation.
+
+ - If both pads accept the caps, the link is then negotiated.
+
+Steps in directed negotiation (gst_pad_try_set_caps):
+
+ - the originator is the pad that gst_pad_try_set_caps() is called
+   on.
+
+ - the elements owning both pads are assumed to be in a non-NULL state
+
+ - the caps argument of try_set_caps() must be fixed.
+ 
+ - gst_pad_get_caps() is called on the peer pad, and intersected with
+   the originating pad's pad template caps and the filter caps.  The
+   caps argument is checked to be a subset of the intersection.  (It's
+   important that this intersection uses the pad _template_ caps.)
+
+ - Fixate functions don't need to be called, since the caps are
+   already fixed.
+
+ - The peer's pad_link function is called.
+
+ - If the peer's pad_link function accepts the caps, the link is then
+   negotiated.
+ 
+ - If the peer's pad_link function refuses the caps, and the link had
+   already been negotiated, the peer's pad_link function is called
+   with the caps of the old negotiation.
+
+ - Note: the originator's pad_link function is _not_ called.  The
+   originator must take appropriate alternative steps.
+
+
+Notes about renegotiation:
+
+ - same as negotiation.  Note that get_caps() functions should always
+   ignore the currently negotiated caps of a link.
+
+ - if renegotiation fails, the previous negotiation is still in effect.
+   If the renegotiation fails in the last pad_link step, the pad_link
+   functions are called with the previously negotiated caps.
+
+
+Notes for sources and sinks:
+
+ - sources and sinks that talk to hardware may not be able to fully
+   describe their available formats, and thus need to rely on pad_link
+   functions to test a particular format.  FIXME: currently, the core
+   completely fails negotiation if a pad_link function refuses a caps,
+   instead of attempting with an alternate caps.
+
+   Example: Assume osssink advertises rate=(int)[8000,48000], but
+   the device cannot actually handle rate=44100 (unknown to osssink).
+   Assume that the pad_link function is called with rate=44100 --
+   ideally, the pad_link function should return GST_PAD_LINK_DELAYED,
+   and future calls to getcaps should return {[8000,44099],[44101,
+   48000]}.  I don't know how to make this easy and/or work well.
+
+
+Notes for decoders/demuxers:
+
+ - Decoders will typically negotiate a sink pad, receive some data,
+   determine the output format, and call try_set_caps() with the given
+   format.  If the output format is non-fixed, gst_pad_renegotiate()
+   may be used instead, in order to have the fixate functions choose
+   the optimal format.  Note that this requires communication so that
+   the pad's getcaps function returns the correct caps.
+
+Notes for converters:
+
+ - Converters change one or more properties of the format of a data
+   stream.  A typical converter's getcaps function will call
+   gst_pad_get_allowed_caps() for the opposite pad in the element,
+   change one or more fields in the caps, and return the result.
+
+ - getcaps function:
+
+   - call gst_pad_get_allowed_caps() on the other pad in the element
+
+   - for each possible format ("A") in the allowed caps, determine all
+     the formats ("B") that your converter could convert the original
+     format (A) to.  The union of all these formats (all the B's) is
+     the caps that should be returned.  (This is how to do it
+     _theoretically_, but an optimal implementation will probably be 
+     quite different.)
+     For example, a simple way to do this for an element that can convert
+     a given field of the caps is to remove the field(s) from the structure,
+     then intersect with the pad template.
+
+   - As an example, videoscale can convert any sized video to any other
+     sized video.  Its getcaps function iterates over each structure in
+     the caps, and replaces the width and height with the range
+     [1,MAXINT].
+ 
+ - pad_link function:
+  
+   - the "otherpad" is the opposite pad in the element.
+
+   - extract fields from the caps that are relevant for your converter
+     handling the format.  Store these in _local_ variables.  (E.g,
+     things like video size, sample rate, etc.)
+
+   - If it's possible to pass buffers through without modifying them
+     (passthrough), you should call gst_try_set_caps() with the caps
+     that was specified as the parameter to the pad_link function.  If
+     this is successful, save the local variables to the element
+     structure, perform whatever other setup is necessary for your
+     element, and return GST_PAD_LINK_OK.
+
+   - Otherwise, you're not not using passthrough, and may need to
+     change the caps on the otherpad to match the given format.
+
+   - If the otherpad is not negotiated (!gst_pad_is_negotiated()),
+     you shouldn't attempt to set a format on it.  It will eventually
+     be negotiated.  Save the local variables to the element structure,
+     perform whatever other setup is necessary, and return
+     GST_PAD_LINK_OK.
+
+   - At this point, the other pad is already negotiated, but won't
+     accept the passthrough format, so you should combine the existing
+     negotiated caps on the otherpad and the caps that was the pad link
+     argument.  This can either be done using existing information in the
+     element that was saved during a previous pad_link call, or you can
+     get the information from the negotiated caps
+     (gst_pad_get_negotiated_caps()).
+
+     As an example, consider the videoscale element.  Assume that
+     videoscale.src has already negotiated "video/x-raw-yuv,
+     format=(fourcc)I420, width=320, height=240", and that the sink
+     pad's link function is called with "video/x-raw-yuv,
+     format=(fourcc)YUY2, width=640, height=480".  Since it's the
+     videoscale element, we can have different width and height
+     fields on the pads, but the format must be the same.  So we'll
+     use the existing negotiated size (640x480), and the new format,
+     and call gst_pad_try_set_caps() with "video/x-raw-yuv,
+     format=(fourcc)I420, width=640, height=480".
+
+     This may seem overkill, but most of the time, you'll end up
+     calling try_set_caps() with the same caps that are currently
+     negotiated -- try_set_caps() just returns GST_PAD_LINK_OK in
+     this case.
+
+   - If gst_pad_try_set_caps() returns GST_PAD_LINK_OK, save the
+     local variables to the element structure.  In any case, return
+     the return value of gst_pad_try_set_caps().
+
+
+Notes for filters:
+
+ - Filters can almost always use gst_pad_proxy_getcaps() as the
+   getcaps function.  This just returns gst_pad_get_allowed_caps()
+   on the otherpad.
+ 
+ - You may be able to use gst_pad_proxy_pad_link() as the pad link
+   function, but only if you don't need to extract parameters from
+   the caps.
+
+
+Notes for encoders/muxers:
+
+ - Encoders and muxers should roughly work like converters.  Many
+   converters are symmetric; encoders and muxers obvious are not,
+   thus it may make the code clearer to have separate src and sink
+   getcaps and pad_link functions.
+
+ - Encoders and muxers should handle multiple negotiations until
+   the first buffer has been passed.  After this point, it's unlikely
+   that additional negotiations will happen in well-constructed
+   pipelines, but it may be wise to "lock" the caps after the
+   muxer has committed to a format.  (FIXME: it's still unclear to
+   me when the caps should get "unlocked".  Obviously at EOS or
+   PAUSED->READY transitions.  Any others?)
+
+ - Locking caps can be done by adding (near the top) of the getcaps
+   function:
+
+   if (my_element->lock_caps) {
+     return gst_pad_get_negotiated_caps (pad);
+   }
+
+
+Explicit caps:
+
+ - There's a hack in the core to make the code for decoder elements
+   a lot simpler.  This hack can be used only for src pads of elements
+   that get their srcpad capabilities directly from the data stream,
+   i.e., decoders, demuxers, and typefind.  This hack overrides the
+   pad's getcaps() and pad_link() function, so that they work correctly
+   in all decoder states.
+
+ - To enable this hack on a pad, call gst_pad_use_explicit_caps().
+
+ - To indicate that a decoder has found the format of the stream, call
+   gst_pad_set_explicit_caps(pad,caps) with the caps of the stream.
+   This caps must be fixed.
+
+ - To indicate that a decoder has lost the format of the stream, i.e.,
+   there's been a NEW_MEDIA event, call gst_pad_set_explicit_caps(pad,
+   NULL).
+
+ - If the explicit caps are set, the getcaps function will return that
+   caps, and the pad_link function will return GST_PAD_LINK_OK.  If
+   the explicit caps are not set, the getcaps function returns the pad
+   template caps, and the pad_link function returns GST_PAD_LINK_DELAYED.
+
+
+
+Other junk:
+
+ - negotiation can happen at any time
+
+ - negotiation can happen multiple times/often happens multiple times
+
+ - initial negotiation can lead to strange caps
+
+ - directed negotiation can happen in either direction (src to sink or
+   sink to src)
+
+ - Other considerations ignored, every pad should have a getcaps function.
+
+ - If a pad's getcaps function returns the same caps in every
+   circumstance, the getcaps function can be omitted.
+   
+ - If you use gst_pad_use_explicit_caps(), the getcaps function must
+   be ommitted.
+
+ - fixate functions are a method for applications to exert influence
+   on how a format is chosen from a caps.  It's also used as a hack to
+   allow elements to do the same.  Element fixate functions are _not_
+   intended to give good results for applications -- they're intended
+   to give non-disgusting results in gst-launch.  Don't attempt to
+   make them do more than they're capable of.
+
+ - Fixate functions should not be implemented on anything except source
+   and sink elements.

+
+	* gst/Makefile.am: Ensure that the marshaller code #includes
+	glib-object.h, and hence the neccessary definitions to enable it to
+	compile.
+	
+	I don't pretend to understand how the marshalling stuff works - I
+	just know that it clearly needs this #include, or something
+	similar.  If there's a more correct fix, someone else can do it. 
+	Possibly this is a glib-genmarshal bug, but I've not got the time
+	to go into that.
+
+2001-06-29 00:58  richardb
+
+	* gst/Makefile.am: Ensure that the gstmarshal.[ch] files are
+	generated in time by generating both files in the same rule:
+	previously, only the .c would be generated in time.  Don't put the
+	files in dists (add a dist-hook to take them out), and clean the
+	files when running distclean.
+
+2001-06-28 22:44  richardb
+
+	* gst/Makefile.am: Make sure conditionally compiled files are added
+	to the dist.
+
+2001-06-28 21:13  sbaker3
+
+	* plugins/alsa/: alsasink.c, alsasrc.c: compile fixes for alsasrc
+	and alsasink - params need more work (odd warning when doing
+	-inspect alsasrc)
+
+2001-06-28 20:32  wtay
+
+	* acconfig.h, configure.base, plugins/Makefile.am: Added a check
+	for the FLAC plugin.
+
+2001-06-28 19:35  richardb
+
+	* configure.base: Fix ALSA check; was overwriting the ALSA_CFLAGS
+	and ALSA_LIBS variables determined for alsa 0.5 with the ones from
+	the check that alsa 0.9 wasn't there.  Now does the 0.9 check
+	first, to avoid this problem.
+
+2001-06-28 17:31  richardb
+
+	* docs/gst/Makefile.am: Remove gstreamer.html from generated files,
+	since it was just a broken copy of one of the other files.  Sort
+	out cleanfiles to some extent.	Note: the make dependencies in this
+	file are completely broken, but it's not    clear how to fix them. 
+	The docs will be built at make install / dist time, as a result.
+
+2001-06-28 17:01  richardb
+
+	* acinclude.m4: Fix a typo in a comment.
+
+2001-06-28 16:39  richardb

+	check to use GST_CHECK_FEATURE.
+
+2001-06-28 16:11  thomasvs
+
+	* plugins/filters/cutter/README: cutter plugin now has a settable
+	pre-record buffer (using GList) README has been fleshed out a bit
+	more
+
+2001-06-28 12:56  richardb
+
+	* configure.base: Actually pass the infomessages variable into
+	config.status, so the message about plugin-builddir gets displayed.
+	
+	We can use this mechanism to display lists of plugins which won't
+	be built: just add the lines to be output at the end of ./configure
+	to $infomessages
+
+2001-06-28 11:57  richardb
+
+	* configure.base: Change plugin-srcdir msg stuff near the end of
+	configure.base to -builddir.
+
+2001-06-27 21:53  thomasvs
+
+	* examples/cutter/cutter.c: implemented ring buffer
+
+2001-06-27 21:53  thomasvs
+
+	* plugins/filters/cutter/: cutter.c, cutter.h: added a GList
+	pre-record buffer
+
+2001-06-27 21:20  wtay
+
+	* test/: dvshow.c, mp2toavi.c: Some small fixes.
+
+2001-06-27 21:19  wtay
+
+	* examples/autoplug/autoplug.c: Small fixes to the autoplugger so
+	that it uses a colorspace element for video.
+
+2001-06-27 21:15  wtay
+
+	* plugins/quicktime/gstquicktimedecoder.c: Make the QT plugin
+	extend from GstBin.
+
+2001-06-27 21:14  wtay
+
+	* plugins/avi/gstavidecoder.c: Make the avidecoder plugin extend
+	from a GstBin.
+
+2001-06-27 21:14  omegahacker
+
+	* configure.base, gstreamer-config.in, gstreamer-uninstalled.pc.in,
+	gstreamer.pc.in: configure.base: changed to 0.2.1, reworked the -D
+	gathering for cflags gstreamer-config.in, gstreamer.pc.in,
+	gstreamer-uninstalled.pc.in:  reworked -D gathering for cflags
+
+2001-06-27 20:45  dlehn
+
+	* plugins/arts/Makefile.am: Fix for automake 1.4 to actually build
+	the generated source.  Clean up generated files.  Make sure only
+	source idl gets into tarball.
+
+2001-06-27 20:22  omegahacker
+
+	* makeconfigure: added _CFLAGS and modified to allow the multiple
+	substitition to occur
+
+2001-06-27 18:22  richardb
+
+	* makeconfigure: Add a hack to ensure that automake picks up the
+	variables AC_SUBSTed in GST_CHECK_CONFIGPROG.
+
+2001-06-27 18:04  richardb
+
+	* acinclude.m4, configure.base: Add a "MODULES" parameter to
+	GST_CHECK_CONFIGPROG, to pass sets of modules to the -config
+	script.  Convert gnome test to use GST_CHECK_CONFIGPROG.
+
+2001-06-27 17:56  richardb
+
+	* acconfig.h, acinclude.m4, configure.base, plugins/Makefile.am,
+	plugins/audiofile/Makefile.am: Remove HAVE_GDK_PIXBUF and
+	HAVE_LIBAUDIOFILE from acconfig.h and AC_DEFINE: nothing uses
+	these.	Add GST_CHECK_CONFIGPROG macro, to check a -config script
+	and set --cflags and --libs from it.  Replace audiofile and
+	gdk-pixbuf checks with calls to this macro.  Change use of
+	HAVE_LIBAUDIOFILE to USE_LIBAUDIOFILE automake conditional.  Change
+	use of AUDIOFILE_LIBS variable to LIBAUDIOFILE_LIBS.
+
+2001-06-27 17:06  richardb
+
+	* acinclude.m4: Fix brokenness with autoconf 2.50.  *sigh*
+
+2001-06-27 16:04  richardb
+
+	* acinclude.m4, configure.base: Add DISABLE-BY-DEFAULT argument to
+	GST_CHECK_FEATURE, to allow a feature to be turned off by default. 
+	Turn of XMMS check using this, rather than a hack.  Fix display of
+	commandline parameters for GST_CHECK_FEATURE and
+	GST_SUBSYSTEM_DISABLE.
+
+2001-06-27 15:07  thomasvs
+
+	* plugins/filters/cutter/: cutter.c, filter.func: fixed cutter
+	plugin
+
+2001-06-27 10:59  richardb
+
+	* acinclude.m4: Add XMMS macro to acinclude.m4, since it's a
+	commonly missing macro.  This joins the ALSA macro, which was
+	already in acinclude.m4 We need some more consistent scheme for
+	dealing with these... :(
+
+2001-06-26 23:26  omegahacker
+
+	* plugins/vgasink/Makefile.am: fixed vgasink Makefile.am, even
+	though vgasink is disabled
+
+2001-06-26 23:15  wtay
+
+	* configure.base, gst/Makefile.am, tools/Makefile.am: Removed the
+	GST_CONFIG_DIR from config.h and made a -D CFLAG for it instead so
+	that we can do full expansion on the sysconfdir.
+
+2001-06-26 22:49  richardb
+
+	* configure.base: Fix up configure --help output:
+	GST_DISABLE_SUBSYSTEM options were not displayed properly.
+
+2001-06-26 22:44  richardb
+
+	* configure.base, gst/elements/Makefile.am, plugins/Makefile.am:
+	Convert XMMS and LIBGHTTP checks to use GST_CHECK_FEATURE() XMMS
+	check is turned off by default (though not in a very neat way)
+
+2001-06-26 22:29  wtay
+
+	* configure.base, plugins/Makefile.am: Removed vgasink for now.
+
+2001-06-26 22:07  wtay

+
+2001-06-26 20:49  omegahacker
+
+	* configure.base: Changes to the GST_SUBSYSTEM_DISABLE macro.
+
+2001-06-26 20:06  richardb
+

+	num_properties gets set.
+
+2001-06-26 19:20  richardb
+
+	* acinclude.m4, configure.base, plugins/Makefile.am: Convert artsc
+	and arts checks to use GST_CHECK_FEATURE.  Extract the checks into

+	* acinclude.m4: Fixes to work properly with automake 1.4
+
+2001-06-26 02:53  richardb
+
+	* Makefile.am, acinclude.m4, autogen.sh, configure.base,
+	makeconfigure: Added feature check macro, GST_CHECK_FEATURE.  Moved
+	generation of configure.{in,ac} into a separate script.  Add hack
+	to the script to stop automake complaining about missing
+	AM_CONDITIONAL call.  Replace ESD check by a call to
+	GST_CHECK_FEATURE.
+
+2001-06-25 22:39  richardb
+
+	* configure.base: Move config dir from /etc/gstreamer to
+	${sysconfdir}/gstreamer by default: more portable, configurable,
+	and standard.

+	gsttypefind.c, gsttypefind.h, gstutils.c, gstutils.h, gstxml.c,
+	gstxml.h: First round of changes to port to GObject.  libgst.la
+	compiles, though there are a few things commented out.

+	to fix that because he researched the problem of glib 2.0 object
+	destruction while doing the first round.  Some of the XML stuff is
+	commented out, but that's an easy fix.
+	
+	Next is the rest of the gst/ directory, then on to the plugins.

+
+	* gstplay/gstplay.c: Find the seeking properties in GstBin objects
+	too.
+
+2001-06-03 13:06  wtay
+
+	* plugins/avi/: gstavidecoder.c, gstavitypes.c,
+	wincodec/gstwindec.c: Added the seeking args to the avi decoder. 
+	Set the buffer flush flag in windec.
+
+2001-06-03 12:28  wtay
+
+	* plugins/cdparanoia/cdparanoia.c: Set the pad caps in _init time.
+
+2001-06-03 12:28  wtay
+
+	* gst/gstpad.c: Set the caps on a proxied pad when the pad is not
+	connected.
+
+2001-06-03 12:20  richardb
+
+	* plugins/arts/Makefile.am: Add dependency so that gst_artsio.cc
+	gets generated in time, and change rule to generate it into a
+	suffix rule.  Register suffix so that automake can set _OBJECTS
+	appropriately.
+
+2001-06-03 02:45  wtay
+
+	* plugins/avi/: gstavidecoder.c, gstavidemux.c, gstavitypes.c:
+	Added support for mjpeg and PCM audio.
+
+2001-06-03 02:00  wtay
+
+	* plugins/jpeg/: gstjpeg.c, gstjpegenc.c: Removed the caps that are
+	not used.
+
+2001-06-03 00:36  richardb
+
+	* configure.base, plugins/arts/Makefile.am: Fix arts check, with
+	artsc-config hackery.
+
+2001-06-02 22:57  wtay
+
+	* plugins/cdparanoia/: cdparanoia.c, cdparanoia.h: Applied the
+	patch from Apoc: ?? _ Add properties cur_sector read only ( get
+	current sector ) ?? _ Add properties last_track read only ( last
+	track of the cd ) ?? _ Add properties cur_track read only ( get the
+	current track ) ?? _ Properties end_track writeable ( last track to
+	rip/play )
+
+2001-06-02 22:52  wtay
+
+	* plugins/cdparanoia/cdparanoia.c: Set the caps of the srcpad right
+	before sending a buffer instead of in the _init function.
+
+2001-06-02 19:26  omegahacker
+
+	* tools/gstreamer-launch.c: added check to make sure there's a
+	pipeline desc before building
+
+2001-06-02 19:11  wtay
+
+	* configure.base: Added the avi makefiles.
+
+2001-06-02 19:08  wtay
+
+	* plugins/avi/: Makefile.am, gstavidecoder.c, gstavidecoder.h,
+	gstavidemux.c, gstavidemux.h, gstavitypes.c, gstavitypes.h,
+	winaudio/Makefile.am, winaudio/aviaudiodecoder.c,
+	winaudio/aviaudiodecoder.h: More rework on the avi decoder.  The
+	avi decoder is now a bin that manages the avidemuxer and the
+	codecs. It uses the autoplugger and avitypes to convert avi types
+	into mime/types and select gstreamer codecs to create an element.
+
+2001-06-02 19:06  richardb
+
+	* autogen.sh: Clarify the messages about the patched automake one
+	more time.  If it's not clear now, and people continue to complain
+	about automake eating their resources, I'm mysteriously unable to
+	hear them.
+
+2001-06-02 17:38  wtay
+
+	* examples/helloworld/helloworld.c: Fixed the helloworld example by
+	using a pipeline as the toplevel element.
+
+2001-06-02 16:33  ajmitch
+
+	* configure.base: Let's just say I have a better understanding of
+	autoconf now (I should really have read the manual first). It helps
+	to remember that yes != no ;)
+
+2001-06-02 14:42  ajmitch
+
+	* configure.base: Automake is picky about white space...
+
+2001-06-02 14:38  ajmitch
+
+	* Makefile.am, configure.base: Added options --disable-tests and
+	--disable-examples for quicker builds for the impatient...
+
+2001-06-02 13:45  wtay
+
+	* gst/gstpad.c: Copy the padtemplate to the ghostpad.
+
+2001-06-02 13:21  richardb
+
+	* configure.base, plugins/gsm/Makefile.am, plugins/gsm/gstgsmdec.h,
+	plugins/gsm/gstgsmenc.h: Fix gsm to check for "gsm.h" as well as
+	"gsm/gsm.h".
+
+2001-06-02 11:42  richardb
+
+	* plugins/sdlsink/Makefile.am: Fix a typoe in sdlsink Makefile.am
+
+2001-06-02 11:40  theuraeus
+
+	* gstreamer.spec.in: 2001-02-06 Christian Schaller
+	<Uraeus@linuxrising.org> * Doh, forgot to update the Changelog
+	inside the SPEC file
+
+2001-06-02 11:38  theuraeus
+
+	* gstreamer.spec.in: 2001-02-06 Christian Schaller
+	<Uraeus@linuxrising.org> * Small fix to group statement for
+	GStreamer
+	
+	My work on the SPEC file making the RPM make one package for all
+	non-core plugins is underway, but I am not ready with it yet.
+
+2001-06-02 03:21  richardb
+
+	* configure.base: Oops: fixed SDL header check: put flags in
+	CPPFLAGS rather than CFLAGS.  We should really filter the
+	SDL_CFLAGS and only pass appropriate options through, but this
+	works well enough for now.
+
+2001-06-02 03:05  richardb
+
+	* configure.base: Improve SDL check: use correct CFLAGS when
+	searching for header.
+
+2001-06-01 23:56  wtay
+
+	* plugins/avi/: Makefile.am, gstavidecoder.c, gstavidecoder.h,
+	playcodecs.c, wincodec/gstwincodec.c, wincodec/gstwindec.c,
+	wincodec/gstwindec.h: Reworked the avi decoder. it works again now
+	(but no sound yet).
+
+2001-06-01 23:36  thomasvs
+
+	* tests/reconnect.c: ok, this works now
+
+2001-06-01 23:23  thomasvs
+
+	* tests/: Makefile.am, reconnect.c: test for disconnect and
+	reconnect of elements
+
+2001-06-01 22:26  theuraeus
+
+	* gstreamer.spec.in: 2001-01-06 Christian Schaller
+	<Uraeus@linuxrising.org> - First batch of upgrades to the SPEC
+	file, this one from   Dennis Bjorklund. Thanks Dennis.
+
+2001-06-01 19:52  wtay
+
+	* configure.base: Added a better SDL_createYUVOverlay check.
+
+2001-06-01 19:30  wtay
+
+	* gst/: gstbin.c, gstpad.c, gstqueue.c, gstscheduler.c,
+	autoplug/autoplugtest.c, autoplug/gststaticautoplugrender.c: Fixed
+	some warnings.
+
+2001-06-01 19:24  wtay
+
+	* tests/: Makefile.am, autoplug.c, capsconnect.c, incsched.c,
+	load.c, loadall.c, mp1vid.c, mp3encode.c, paranoia.c, reaping.c,
+	registry.c, threadlock.c, nego/nego1.c, sched/runxml.c: Fixed a

+
+2001-06-01 19:09  wtay

+	video2mp1.c: Fixed some compile warnings.
+
+2001-06-01 18:55  hadess
+
+	* REQUIREMENTS: - added url to openquicktime
+
+2001-06-01 18:42  hadess
+
+	* REQUIREMENTS: - added some more urls
+
+2001-06-01 18:42  wtay
+
+	* gstplay/gstplay.c: Print out a warning when the colorspace plugin
+	is not found and try to do without it...
+
+2001-06-01 18:32  theuraeus
+
+	* LICENSE_readme, REQUIREMENTS: 2001-01-06 Christian Schaller
+	<Uraeus@linuxrising.org> * A few URL additions to the REQUIREMENTS
+	file * LICENCE readme containing licensing details on our plugins
+
+2001-06-01 17:57  wtay
+
+	* README, REQUIREMENTS: Slightly changed the README, we are not
+	really tied to GNOME.  Added more optional libs to REQUIREMENTS.
+	someone should complete the URLS.
+
+2001-06-01 17:46  wtay
+
+	* plugins/effects/volume/volume.c: Removed the soundcard.h include
+	line.
+
+2001-06-01 16:29  thomasvs
+
+	* gst/elements/gstdisksink.c: coded small bit in to allow changing
+	of output location
+
+2001-06-01 14:27  richardb
+
+	* tools/README: Add a note about gstreamer-complete
+
+2001-06-01 14:03  richardb
+
+	* configure.base: More tidyup to SDL check.
+
+2001-06-01 13:36  richardb
+
+	* configure.base: Fix SDL check Check for Overlay stuff, which
+	isn't in SDL version 1.0
+
+2001-05-31 23:57  hadess
+
+	* REQUIREMENTS: - added urls to the required libs, with a lot of
+	added libs
+
+2001-05-31 21:20  richardb
+
+	* REQUIREMENTS, configure.base: Add comments to many (but not all
+	:( ) AC_DEFINES in configure scripts.  Add note about debian
+	packages for building documentation.
+
+2001-05-31 21:14  richardb
+
+	* plugins/esd/esdsink/Makefile.am: Add a CFLAGS line: just luck
+	that it's not been needed so far.
+
+2001-05-31 21:13  richardb
+
+	* plugins/artsd/Makefile.am: Remove a redundant line, and add a
+	comment about one which will become redundant in future.
+
+2001-05-31 20:52  wtay
+
+	* testsuite/refcounting/Makefile.am: Removed the thread test so
+	make distcheck works.
+
+2001-05-31 20:18  wtay
+
+	* testsuite/refcounting/Makefile.am: Added the mem.h file in
+	noinst_HEADERS.
+
+2001-05-31 20:16  richardb
+
+	* plugins/arts/Makefile.am: Remove generated files from the dist.
+
+2001-05-31 20:08  richardb
+
+	* configure.base, idiottest.mak: Fix a couple of formatting errors
+	in idiottest, and add plugin-srcdir warning to configure.base.
+
+2001-05-31 19:42  wtay
+
+	* plugins/avi/Makefile.am: Fixed the codectest.
+
+2001-05-31 19:35  richardb
+
+	* Makefile.am, idiottest.mak, include/Makefile.am: Abstract the
+	plugin-srcdir installation idiottest into a separate file, and
+	include it from the include Makefile.am, to ensure that it gets
+	called at the start of a make install process, not after the whole
+	thing has happened.
+
+2001-05-31 19:31  wtay
+
+	* include/Makefile.am: Added gstaudio.h to noinst_HEADERS.
+
+2001-05-31 19:03  richardb
+
+	* docs/gst/Makefile.am: Add rules to ensure that the libgst.la and
+	libgstelements.la exist when trying to link the scanner with them. 
+	Fix mkdirs so that they don't fall over if directories already
+	exist.
+
+2001-05-31 18:32  richardb
+
+	* plugins/arts/Makefile.am: Put gst_artsio.idl in
+	libgst_arts_la_SOURCES instead of gst_artsio.cc (which is generated
+	from it).  This ensures that the original source is present, and
+	also allows make dist to work on machines which don't have mcopidl
+	and the arts idl stuff installed.
+	
+	It is possible that gst_artsio.cc should be put in EXTRA_DIST, but
+	I argue against it since as far as I can tell it can be generated
+	on any system which has arts installed (mcopidl is in the libarts
+	package on debian), and putting it in EXTRA_DIST requires that
+	mcopidl is present in order to run make dist.
+
+2001-05-31 15:19  richardb
+
+	* configure.base: Add AS and ASFLAGS to configure.base, fixing the
+	build with automake 1.4g AS is defined in a hacky way: I've asked
+	on the automake list for help doing this properly.
+
+2001-05-31 10:53  thomasvs
+
+	* plugins/oss/gstosssrc.c: some small cleanups before maybe doing
+	some real work on this
+
+2001-05-30 23:06  thomasvs
+
+	* plugins/oss/gstosssrc.c: The weird thing only happens on one of
+	my sound cards.
+
+2001-05-30 22:35  thomasvs
+
+	* include/gstaudio.h: header file for standard audio stuff for
+	plugins
+
+2001-05-30 22:27  omegahacker
+
+	* configure.base: added no-alsa warning and made 0.9 check
+	conditional on alsa existing at all
+
+2001-05-30 22:15  wtay
+
+	* plugins/wav/gstparsewav.c: Major cleanups so that it actually
+	works.
+
+2001-05-30 22:14  wtay
+
+	* gst/gstprops.c: Fixed a bug so that gst_props_new (NULL) == NULL
+
+2001-05-30 21:54  omegahacker
+
+	* plugins/sdlsink/sdlvideosink.c: added SDL_INIT_NOPARACHUTE flag
+	to SDL_Init, to disable one of the most annoying features IMO of
+	SDL
+
+2001-05-30 21:36  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/gstpad.c: stupid mistake, I put != instead of == in the
+	g_return_if's
+
+2001-05-30 21:13  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/gstpad.c: added sanity checks to make sure _push and _pull
+	don't get called on pads of the wrong direction
+
+2001-05-30 20:07  sbaker3
+
+	* plugins/filters/ladspa/: gstladspa.c, gstladspa.h: beginnings of
+	inplace mono chain func
+
+2001-05-30 17:37  thomasvs
+
+	* plugins/oss/gstosssrc.c: switched some lines around
+
+2001-05-30 17:10  thomasvs
+
+	* plugins/oss/gstosssrc.c: added caps to osssrc found a weird
+	thing, don't know yet what to do about it
+
+2001-05-30 16:16  richardb
+
+	* README, autogen.sh: Automatically generate a patched automake if
+	needed, and put instructions in the README about how to use such a
+	patched automake.
+
+2001-05-30 15:39  richardb
+
+	* Makefile.am: Add configure.base and autogen.sh to distributions. 
+	Add rules to keep configure.in and configure.ac up-to-date.
+
+2001-05-30 15:22  richardb
+
+	* autogen.sh, configure.ac, configure.base, configure.in:  * create
+	a configure.base file, containing the contents of
+	   configure.{in,ac}, with those lines specific to one file
+	prepended by
+	   "SUBSTFOR configure.in:" or "SUBSTFOR configure.ac:"
+	appropriately.
+	
+	 * Add lines to autogen.sh to generate configure.in and
+	configure.ac
+	   automatically from this file. (Very simple sed scripts)
+	
+	 * Remove configure.in and configure.ac
+	
+	This shouldn't cause any problems to anyone, and should make it
+	easy to do work on configure scripts by just working on
+	configure.base.
+
+2001-05-30 14:54  thomasvs
+
+	* plugins/filters/passthrough/passthrough.c: added signed support
+	implemented include/gstaudio.h use
+
+2001-05-30 14:25  richardb
+
+	* configure.ac, configure.in: More small changes to bring the two
+	scripts closer together.  Turned off building docs by default in
+	configure.ac.  Only diffs are now essential due to changes from
+	autoconf 2.13 to 2.50.
+
+2001-05-30 13:56  richardb
+
+	* autogen.sh: Deal more gracefully with being either unable to
+	check that automake is patched (will now just give a small
+	warning), or finding that automake definitely isn't patched (will
+	give a big loud warning recommend stopping the build and sleep
+	briefly to give the user a chance to read the message).  Will
+	eventually try to do the build anyway though.
+	
+	Also, don't abort if autoconf or automake return error codes: they
+	both seem able to do so even when having produced viable results.
+
+2001-05-29 23:10  wtay
+
+	* plugins/filters/colorspace/: Makefile.am, colorspace.c,
+	colorspace.h, yuv2rgb.c, yuv2rgb.h: Added more colorspace functions
+	for YUV->RGB
+
+2001-05-29 17:40  richardb
+
+	* autogen.sh: Add checks for appropriate versions of automake.	Add
+	check that automake has been patched if it is a version which
+	requires a patch.  Please check that this doesn't cause problems:
+	it's a bit of a hairy test, so I might well have mucked it up and
+	broken some people's build systems.  Hope not, though. ;-)
+
+2001-05-29 17:39  hadess
+
+	* plugins/gnomevfs/gnomevfssrc.c: - fix for when size can't be
+	acquired (fixes icecast streaming)
+
+2001-05-29 17:38  richardb
+
+	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, configure.in: Add idiot test to stop
+	the installing of versions with plugin srcdir enabled.
+
+2001-05-29 16:19  richardb
+
+	* configure.ac, configure.in: Fix differences between configure.in
+	and configure.ac which were trivial or due merely to formatting
+	differences.  diff can now be used to see only the significant
+	differences, which should be helpful in keeping these two files in
+	sync.
+
+2001-05-29 13:43  richardb
+
+	* gst/Makefile.am.future: Update Makefile.am.future - a replacement
+	for Makefile.am which uses features present in recent versions of
+	automake (>1.4d) to avoid horrendous hackery.
+
+2001-05-29 13:31  richardb
+
+	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac, configure.in: Simplify alsa checking:
+	we can use the standard AM_PATH_ALSA macro to check that we don't
+	have alsa 0.9.x: we just need to specify something for
+	ACTION_NOT_FOUND to override the default AC_MSG_ERROR behaviour, so
+	I've put a colon for ACTION_NOT_FOUND. ;-) Also, update the alsa
+	macro in acinclude with the latest from the alsa project CVS.
+
+2001-05-28 23:23  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/gstsparc.h: fixed #define line continuation in gstsparc.h
+
+2001-05-28 23:02  wtay
+
+	* configure.ac, configure.in: Added a check for gsm/gsm.h
+
+2001-05-28 22:41  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/gstinfo.c: changed debug so it always prints pid and cid in
+	color
+
+2001-05-28 22:02  wtay
+
+	* configure.ac: Removed the -pre0
+
+2001-05-28 22:00  wtay
+
+	* plugins/Makefile.am: Added gsm to subds.
+
+2001-05-28 21:47  wtay
+
+	* configure.ac: Added the refcounting to the output targets.
+
+2001-05-28 21:36  wtay
+
+	* acconfig.h, configure.ac, configure.in: Added a check for libgsm
+
+2001-05-28 21:22  wtay
+
+	* configure.ac: Updated to match configure.in
+
+2001-05-28 21:05  wtay
+
+	* configure.ac: The configure file for autoconf 2.50
+
+2001-05-28 20:59  omegahacker
+
+	* ABOUT-NLS: added blank file to keep autoconf happy, fill it in
+	later
+
+2001-05-28 20:34  omegahacker
+
+	* plugins/avi/Makefile.am: changed srcdir to builddir for .la
+
+2001-05-28 20:33  omegahacker
+
+	* configure.in: attempt at a fixed alsa check to guarantee 0.5.x
+
+2001-05-28 20:09  omegahacker
+
+	* libs/getbits/Makefile.am, libs/idct/Makefile.am,
+	plugins/xvideosink/Makefile.am: distcheck cleanups
+
+2001-05-28 08:46  omegahacker
+
+	* configure.in, gstreamer-uninstalled.pc.in, gstreamer.pc.in,
+	gst/Makefile.am: some fixes to handle builddirs, which distcheck
+	uses, along with complete .pc files
+
+2001-05-28 01:07  hadess
+
+	* plugins/gnomevfs/gnomevfssrc.c: - cleanups
+
+2001-05-28 00:57  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/gstpad.c, gst/gstthread.c, gst/elements/gstidentity.c,
+	plugins/xvideosink/xvideosink.c, tools/gstreamer-inspect.c: Added
+	some caps != NULL checks.  Patched up a problem with the thread
+	handling when the iteration fails.  Cleaned up the output of
+	-inspect a tiny bit.
+
+2001-05-28 00:52  omegahacker
+
+	* configure.in: removed a spare alsa check, and made sure it fails
+	for alsa 0.9.x
+
+2001-05-28 00:12  wtay
+
+	* examples/mixer/Makefile.am: Added the headers
+
+2001-05-28 00:01  wtay
+
+	* plugins/arts/Makefile.am: Add more hardcoded paths for includes.
+
+2001-05-27 23:55  wtay
+
+	* tests/nego/nego1.c: Updated for new API calls.
+
+2001-05-27 23:45  wtay
+
+	* plugins/sdlsink/Makefile.am: Added the header file.
+
+2001-05-27 23:26  wtay
+
+	* configure.in.ac250: Added refcounting to the targets.
+
+2001-05-27 23:25  wtay
+
+	* testsuite/: Makefile.am, capsnego/Makefile.am,
+	refcounting/Makefile.am: Makfeile updates.
+
+2001-05-27 22:56  omegahacker
+
+	* Makefile.am, acconfig.h, configure.in, gst/autoplug/Makefile.am,
+	plugins/1394/Makefile.am, plugins/aasink/Makefile.am,
+	plugins/alaw/Makefile.am, plugins/filters/level/Makefile.am,

+	plugins/filters/volenv/Makefile.am, plugins/mulaw/Makefile.am,
+	plugins/oss/Makefile.am, plugins/xvideosink/Makefile.am,
+	tests/Makefile.am, testsuite/Makefile.am: various build fixes
+
+2001-05-27 21:52  wtay
+
+	* plugins/Makefile.am: Only build the quiktime plugin if the
+	openquicktime library was found.
+
+2001-05-27 21:52  wtay
+
+	* configure.in, configure.in.ac250: Added a check for
+	openquicktime.
+
+2001-05-27 18:02  sbaker3
+
+	* tools/gstreamer-complete.c: now builds for those who are too lazy
+	to upgrade their xml libraries
+
+2001-05-27 16:13  hadess
+
+	* plugins/gnomevfs/gnomevfssrc.c: - added eos-hack signal to the
+	source, and fix the seek segfaults

+	current code - add more and more plugins.
+
+2001-05-04 23:14  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/gstelement.h, gst/gstscheduler.c,
+	plugins/mp3decode/mad/gstmad.c: Add the GST_ELEMENT_NO_ENTRY flag,
+	which when set will force the scheduler to skip over an element as
+	an option for the first cothread jump.	This is needed because
+	libraries like mad don't ever seem to want to quit.  Thus they
+	ignore COTHREAD_STOPPING and can't be trusted to be the entry.
+
+2001-05-04 21:43  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/: gstinfo.c, gstpad.c, gstscheduler.c: Some minor DEBUG

+
+2001-05-03 23:29  wtay

+	because some systems (PPC) cannot handle passing a va_list by
+	reference.
+
+2001-05-03 22:44  wtay
+
+	* gst/gstparse.c: Added dynamic pads to the command line parser.
+	
+	  ./gstreamer-launch disksrc location=/some/systemstream.mpg !
+	mpeg1parse video_00!
+		    queue ! \{ mp1videoparse ! mpeg_play ! aasink \}
+	
+	will now work.
+
+2001-05-03 21:06  wtay

+
+2001-05-03 11:16  thomasvs
+
+	* examples/mixer/mixer.c, plugins/filters/adder/adder.c: * made a
+	quick hack in adder to set GST_ELEMENT_COTHREAD_STOPPING after	
+	one interation to force return to main program; should probably be
+	fixed	in a better way * cleaned mixer up, it now works with
+	delayed start.	Drinks are in order.
+
+2001-05-03 00:46  wtay
+
+	* docs/manual/: Makefile.am, autoplugging.sgml, bins.sgml,
+	buffers.sgml, elements.sgml, gstreamer-manual.sgml,

+	about autoplugging.
+
+2001-05-03 00:44  wtay
+
+	* gst/gstinfo.h: Added and extra whitespace before ## args
+	(remember it eats all non whitespace chars to the left if it's
+	empty).
+
+2001-05-03 00:12  wtay
+
+	* examples/plugins/example.c: We don't want to teach you bad
+	habbits, so here's a fix for a memleak in the example plugin.
+
+2001-05-02 21:27  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/gstinfo.h: re-enabled the funcptr hash table
+
+2001-05-02 21:16  wtay
+
+	* examples/mixer/mixer.c: Added a WITH_BUG flag to trigger the
+	scheduling error we're trying to chase.

+
+	* gst/: gst.c, gstcaps.c, gstelement.c, gstelementfactory.c,
+	gstinfo.c, gstinfo.h, gstpad.c, gstprops.c, gstqueue.c: Converted
+	the DEBUG system to look like the INFO system, with a function
+	pointer that can be replaced.  Not done with everything, since it
+	seems that we need an ERROR system plus a FATAL error, or maybe
+	just an ERROR system with a severity, and depending on this the
+	DEBUG system might again be changed to have a single or at least
+	fewer handlers.
+	
+	Also did a bit of work fixing up the actual DEBUG and INFO commands
+	scattered throughout the code.	We still have over 500 of these in
+	gst/*.c alone...
+
+2001-05-02 20:11  thomasvs

+
+	* plugins/filters/passthrough/: README, filter.func, level.c,

+	print useful info.
+
+2001-05-01 22:41  omegahacker
+
+	* test/mpeg2parse4.c: file mpeg2parse4.c was initially added on
+	branch BRANCH-INCSCHED1.
+
+2001-05-01 22:41  omegahacker
+
+	* configure.in, gstreamer.pc.in, gst/Makefile.am, gst/gstbin.c,

+	gst/gstscheduler.h, test/.cvsignore, test/Makefile.am,

+
+2001-04-30 21:40  richardb
+
+	* configure.in: Tighten some library checks (check for header files
+	as well as libraries) Also, clean up structure slightly: put all
+	AC_DEFINEs for feature checks into the appropriate section at end. 
+	This structure allows user parameter code which overrides the
+	feature selection to be kept together in a section after the
+	feature checks but before the AC_DEFINES and AM_CONDITIONALs.
+
+2001-04-30 20:51  thomasvs

+	bogus reference to audioraw.h
+
+2001-04-29 23:27  wtay
+
+	* examples/mixer/mixer.c: Changed the way the typefind function
+	works by creating a little pipeline as the toplevel bin..
+
+2001-04-29 22:56  thomasvs
+
+	* examples/mixer/mixer.c: trying to convert mixer to incsched, not

+
+2001-04-28 03:54  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/: gstbin.c, gstclock.c, gstelement.c, gstelementfactory.c,
+	gstinfo.c, gstpad.c, gstpipeline.c, gstthread.c, gsttype.c,
+	gstutils.c: Updated the colorization a bit more, and did a
+	significant pass through all the other code to change categories on
+	DEBUG and INFO statements to be correct, and not simply zero. 
+	There are still more, but this is a good first pass.
+
+2001-04-28 02:46  mhowell
+

+
+2001-04-26 01:25  omegahacker
+
+	* tests/mp1vid.c: file mp1vid.c was initially added on branch

+
+	* tests/mp1vid.c: added mp1vid to CVS

+2001-04-26 01:20  omegahacker

+
+	* plugins/dv/dvdec.c: cleanup of the dvdec stuff, somewhat
+
+2001-04-26 00:56  omegahacker
+
+	* configure.in: turn off optimization when profiling (ackcvs diff
+	configure.in) because something segfaults if we don't
+
+2001-04-26 00:30  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/cothreads.c: fixed a locking issue
+
+2001-04-25 23:32  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/: cothreads.c, cothreads.h, gstelement.c, gstelement.h,
+	gstscheduler.c, gstscheduler.h: Added element-level locking
+	support, implemented for cothreads with a mutex held whenever an
+	element is actually currently running.	This should be done with
+	atomic variables eventually, but the best I can find is to use
+	<asm/spinlock.h> from the kernel, which brings in too much for my
+	taste.
+	
+	Also increased cothread stack size to 32KB and max cothread count
+	to 64, which fits within the default pthread 2MB stack.  It would
+	probably be good to do a pthread_attr_getstacksize() to verify that
+	it's 2MB, and if linuxthreads had a pthread_attr_setstacksize(), we
+	could remove these limits.
+
+2001-04-25 12:49  richardb
+
+	* examples/Makefile.am, test/Makefile.am, test/mp3.c,

+	example only compile if gnome headers are present.

+
+	* gst/: gstbuffer.c, gstbuffer.h: - commented out remainder of Meta
+	stuff - enhanced mem_chunk allocation to round up to nearest 32
+	bytes	 this helps ensure that GstBuffers are more likely to be on
+	cache-lines - added free() and copy() function pointers to
+	GstBuffer - added code in _destroy and _copy to use above routines
+	if !NULL - fixed up _copy code to suck less

+	too
+	 * plugins/Makefile.am - removed a spare trailing backslash
+	 * plugins/arts/gst_artsio_impl.cc - change the scale back to 0.5
+	 * plugins/oss/gstosssrc.c - change name slightly to match osssink

+	large patch:  - changed the API for the padtemplates:	   - remove
+	the factories (array of pointers) for the padtemplates,       
+	properties and caps. The static array was a nice idea but
+	converting	  all the property values to a gpointer was not a
+	good idea.	   float properties were not possible, and casting
+	a gint to a pointer	    is not very portable. The new API just
+	uses the _padtemplate_new,	   _caps_new and _props_new
+	functions to create the templates.	   This has the added
+	benefit that the API is now uniform for static	       and dynamic
+	templates and that the code can be made cleaner.       - lots of
+	cleanups in the way the capabilities are constructed (va_list)	   
+	 - lots of updates for all the plugins (new API)   - docs updates
+	(new API)   - removed the videoraw docs.

+2001-03-09 20:05  wtay
+

+2001-03-09 12:08  richardb
+
+	* Makefile.am, configure.in, testsuite/Makefile.am,
+	testsuite/test_gst_init.c: Added a testsuite.  This currently only
+	has one test, which replicates a problem just submitted to the

+	
+	I hope noone disagrees that we need a testsuite.  Also, hopefully
+	we all think that a tiny testsuite which is easy to add tests to is
+	much better than a huge project to create a complete testsuite,
+	which never gets started because its too big and scary.
+	
+	I suggest that tests get created whenever someone has a spare
+	moment, or whenever a bug is reported (to replicate the problem,
+	and thus be sure that when fixed it stays fixed), and before making
+	a change to a piece of code to ensure that it remains working.
+	
+	If we all add little tests occasionally, then we'll have a good
+	useful testsuite before we know it.  All you need to do is make a

+	for the manual from gstreamer to index; a change to the link to the
+	manual on the website will thus be needed when the online version

+	These changes should make it possible to view the GStreamer

+	autoplugger to a plugin with gst_plugin_add_autoplugger    - the
+	autopluggers can be queried using _get_list    - save/load
+	autoplugger descriptions in the XML registry	- load the
+	autoplugger only when needed	- a signal can be attached to the
+	autoplugger to be notified of	   new objects.    - improved the
+	media player to use the new autoplugger    - updated
+	gstreamer-inspect for the autoplugger and types  added EOS to the

+	tags)

+	plugins/mpeg1/mpeg_play/gstmpeg_play.c, test/mp1parse.c,
+	tests/.cvsignore, tests/Makefile.am, tests/autoplug.c: Updated the
+	autoplugger:   - moved all of the code out of gstpipeline.c to
+	autoplug.c   - The autoplugger now creates a GstElement based on
+	the given src and     sink caps. The API now is:	GstElement*
+	gst_autoplug_caps_list (GList *srcpad, GList *sinkpad, ...);   -
+	the typefind function is moved from gstpipeline.c to gstplay.c. Not
+	sure	 if this is right behaviour but we need at least a bin in
+	order to run	 the typedetect functions.    - fixed a bug in
+	gstbin.c where the MANAGER flag of the bin was not cleared     
+	when going to the NULL state.	 - a bug in the videosink was
+	fixed. It was possible that more instances	of the video widget
+	were created, causing major errors.    - commented out most of the
+	'old' autoplug examples.    - added the new autoplugger to
+	gstplay.c. There still is a bit of hacking	needed to insert a
+	queue into the autogenerated element. This will be fixed      when
+	the autoplugger can also create the video/audio elements.  Fixed
+	some more extranous spaces problems in various files.

+	is now specified by a type (OFFSET_LEN, TIME_LEN, etc.) and two
+	guint64's.  They are offset and len, where offset can be used for
+	the time field, and len would be zero or the time unit (say, 33ms
+	for video).

+	to in order to insert its XML into the tree.  You can catch the
+	object_loaded signal in GstXML to parse the user supplied XML data
+	in the stream. The object_loaded signal is implemented with a
+	custom made class signal. All GstObject classes now automatically
+	create a GstSignalObject that serves as a proxy to the user app
+	when an object is loaded. All objects are currently responsible to
+	emit the class signal themselves.  runxml and createxml serve as an
+	example how the XML hooks can be used to insert and retrieve custom
+	XML tags.

+	
+	 - moved the gchar *name to GstObject, removed the ones in
+	GstElement and
+	   GstPad.
+	 - moved the parent handling completely into GstObject. This cause
+	*all* of
+	   the plugins to fail (except those that used gst_pad_get_parent)
+	 - rearanged the XML save handling.
+	   - GstObject now has a class function save/restore_thyself.
+	   - GstObject has a generic method gst_object_save_thyself, this
+	makes it
+	     possible to fire a signal wehever a new object is loaded. This
+	is needed
+	     so we can add XML save hooks.
+	   - GstXML API has changed slightly. You now have to create a
+	GstXML object
+	     first before you can actually load something. This makes it
+	possible to
+	     attach a signal to GstXML whenever an object is loaded. I'm
+	not sure we
+	     will keep this interface.
+	 - GstObject can now print the path_string without knowing about
+	the GstPad and
+	   GstElement types.
+	 - Added gst_bin_get_by_name_recurse_up to lookup an element in the
+	current
+	   element hierarchy.
+	 - added XML namespaces to the saved pipelines the namespace is:
+	   http://gstreamer.net/gst-core/1.0/
+	   namespaces are needed to distinguish user generated XML from the
+	core XML.
+	
+	Note that the plugins still contain a macro GST_OBJECT_PARENT that
+	will be replaced with gst_pad_get_parent shortly.

+	output from a source pad, in an appropriate format, so that another
+	plugin could graphically display this.
+
+2001-01-17 07:43  wtay
+
+	* examples/typefind/: Makefile, Makefile.am: Oops
+
+2001-01-17 01:59  richardb
+
+	* tools/gstreamer-register.c: Fix permissions problems: the
+	directory will now always be created mode 2755.  In addition, the
+	temporary file is given restricted permissions, and the permissions
+	on the registry file are preserved if one already exists, or 666
+	(and modified by the umask) if one doesn't already exist.
+
+2001-01-17 00:02  wtay
+
+	* configure.in: Added typefind example to configure.in
+
+2001-01-17 00:01  wtay
+
+	* examples/: autoplug/autoplug.c, typefind/Makefile,
+	typefind/typefind.c: Added the typefind example from the manual
+
+2001-01-16 23:35  wtay
+
+	* docs/manual/: dynamic.sgml, programs.sgml, typedetection.sgml,
+	utility.sgml: Manual updates and additions
+
+2001-01-15 21:10  richardb
+
+	* plugins/esd/esdsink/esdsink.c: Correct the pads for esdsink
+	plugin, after I realised they were wrong during a conversation
+	about pads with wtay. ;-)
+
+2001-01-15 19:25  wtay
+
+	* gst/: gstbin.c, gstelement.c: Fixed the state change code in
+	gstelement that broke with the conversion of the states to a
+	bitfield.
+
+2001-01-15 00:53  richardb
+
+	* plugins/mp3decode/mpg123/: layer3.c, mpg123.h: Added some
+	conditionals to ensure that the i486 stuff is used only in x86
+	architectures.	Now links on PPC.
+
+2001-01-15 00:53  wtay
+
+	* docs/manual/: dynamic.sgml, pads.sgml, quotes.sgml: Updated docs
+	with dynamic pads Fixed quotes
+
+2001-01-14 22:28  wtay
+
+	* gstplay/Makefile.am: Added gst_libs to Makefile
+
+2001-01-14 22:25  richardb
+
+	* docs/manuals.mak: Fix build problem when don't have db2html, or a
+	directory to put the manual in: was trying to make a symlink in the
+	non-existant directory, and causing the build to stop.
+
+2001-01-14 22:24  richardb
+
+	* gst/Makefile.am: Adding nasty hack to rules to generate
+	cothreads.{o,lo}, to get dependencies right.  Rules copied from
+	automake, and therefore a bit dependent on automake keeping doing
+	dependency things the same kind of way, but it should work as long
+	as automake puts dependencies into .deps/*.P
+
+2001-01-14 22:23  wtay

+	Check docs/random/omega/build/TODO for a list of things that I had

+	changed the STATE enum to a bitfield instead of sequential numbers.
+
+2001-01-14 21:38  omegahacker
+
+	* tools/: Makefile.am, gstreamer-launch.c: fixed an odd case with
+	the launcher, didn't deal with argc properly
+
+2001-01-14 14:57  wtay
+
+	* gst/cothreads.c: Change MAP_ANONYMOUS to MAP_ANON in the mmap for
+	BSD compatibility
+
+2001-01-14 14:43  wtay
+
+	* gst/elements/: gstfakesink.c, gstfakesrc.c, gstfakesrc.h,
+	gstidentity.c, gstqueue.c: Added an extra signal_cond to queue to
+	make sure that the waiting thread is woken up. Can somebody with
+	queue problems verifify that this does improve the situation a bit.
+	I'm suspecting that something else is going on, like a pthreads bug
+	or something.  Small updates to the fake elements.
+
+2001-01-14 12:42  richardb
+
+	* REQUIREMENTS: Added a couple of lines about debian packages.
+
+2001-01-14 04:45  wtay
+
+	* docs/manual/quotes.sgml: Updated quotes :-)
+
+2001-01-13 19:04  wtay
+
+	* docs/random/wtay/eos5: Antoher way of dealing with EOS. This
+	proposal does not use the recursion to propagate the EOS signal.
+	This implies that an element cannot deny an EOS signal anymore but
+	since the signal is generated when a NULL buffer is pushed,
+	somebody did something wrong anyway.
+
+2001-01-13 15:47  wtay
+
+	* docs/random/wtay/eos4: Added an updated use case for EOS
+	handling.
+
+2001-01-13 14:45  wtay
+
+	* docs/random/TODO-post-0.1.0: Updated the TODO list...

+
+	* gst/: gstbin.c, gstbin.h, gstcaps.h, gstelement.c, gstelement.h,
+	gstpad.c, gstpad.h, gstplugin.h, gstprops.h, gstxml.h: include
+	parser.h instead of gnome-xml/parser.h untill xml-config is
+	fixed...
+
+2001-01-13 02:55  omegahacker
+
+	* configure.in: turned static library build back off for
+	development
+
+2001-01-13 02:12  wtay
+
+	* docs/random/wtay/eos3: Added case6: a multithreaded audio mixer
+	setup.
+
+2001-01-13 00:14  wtay
+
+	* plugins/mp3decode/mpg123/mpg123.c: Use glib function to convert
+	be->le
+
+2001-01-12 23:37  wtay
+
+	* libs/getbits/gstgetbits.c: Added config.h as an include to make

+
+2001-01-12 22:44  wtay
+
+	* docs/random/wtay/eos3: Added a simple mp3 mixer pipeline setup

+
+2001-01-12 20:54  wtay
+
+	* ChangeLog: Updated ChangeLog :-)
+
+2001-01-12 20:48  wtay
+
+	* plugins/mpeg2/mpeg2dec/: idct.c, motion_comp.c: Make sure the
+	mmx/sse code is not used on non i386
+
+2001-01-12 20:44  wtay
+
+	* configure.in: Check for more atomic operations
+
+2001-01-12 20:25  wtay
+
+	* plugins/mpeg2/mpeg2dec/decode.c: Removed include from mpeg2dec
+	for mmx.h
+
+2001-01-12 20:15  wtay
+
+	* plugins/mpeg2/mpeg2dec/Makefile.am: Made sure mmx compilation is
+	not performed on non intel
+
+2001-01-12 18:51  wtay
+
+	* docs/random/wtay/: eos2, eos3: While typing on eos2 about the EOS
+	handling, I got an idea and started eos3. eos3 takes a different
+	approach by merging the eos detection and the scheduling in a quite
+	elegant way. I'm not sure we handle the scheduling like this
+	though...
+
+2001-01-11 23:20  wtay
+
+	* plugins/mpeg1/mpeg_play/recon_sse.s: Removed /* */ comments and
+	replaced them with a # comment as suggested by Peter Weilbacher
+
+2001-01-11 23:15  wtay
+
+	* plugins/mpeg2/mpeg2enc/: bdist1_mmx.s, bdist1_sse.s,

+	dist1_01_sse.s, dist1_10_mmx.s, dist1_10_sse.s, dist1_11_mmx.s,
+	dist1_11_sse.s, dist2_mmx.s, variance_mmx.s: Fixed the comments in
+	the asm sources from /* */ to #, it seems to confuse some compilers
+
+2001-01-11 22:09  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/: gstpad.c, gstpad.h: renamed private to element_private, to
+	make obvious its usage restrictions
+
+2001-01-11 22:03  omegahacker
+
+	* gst/: gstpad.c, gstpad.h: added gpointer private to pads, so

+
+2001-01-11 21:53  wtay
+
+	* Makefile.am: Added the REQUIREMENTS file to distdir

+2001-01-09 20:54  omegahacker
+
+	* docs/manual/quotes.sgml: latest irc insanity

+2001-01-09 20:53  wtay
+
+	* REQUIREMENTS: Added /usr/lib/win32/ windows libraries in the
+	REQUIREMENTS

+
+	* docs/manual/: Makefile.am, gstreamer-manual.sgml, quotes.sgml:
+	Add a "quotes" section to the gstreamer manual.  This may not be an

+
+2001-01-08 01:23  richardb
+

+
+2001-01-07 16:48  richardb
+
+	* tools/gstreamer-register.c: Fix typos in save_regsitry()
+
+2001-01-07 16:14  richardb
+
+	* tools/gstreamer-register.c: Folling wtays suggestion, I was going
+	to start using xmlDocDump, to avoid a symlink attack on the
+	temporary registry file.  Unfortunately, xmlDocDump doesn't give
+	any indication whether its successful, so I've #ifdefed this out
+	and left the original in place.  Since the tmp file is in
+	/etc/gstreamer, this should be okay for the moment, but I shall ask
+	the libxml people to add some way of getting the success value of
+	DocDump so we can use that in future.
+
+2001-01-07 15:31  richardb
+
+	* acinclude.m4: Slight tweak: now I just need to send the modified
+	version off to the alsa people.
+
+2001-01-07 15:25  richardb
+
+	* acinclude.m4: New macro for testing for ALSA libraries. 
+	Understands the ACTION_IF_FOUND and ACTION_IF_NOT_FOUND arguments.
+
+2001-01-07 15:20  richardb
+
+	* gst/cothreads.c, gst/gstplugin.c, tools/gstreamer-register.c:
+	gstreamer-register will now never cause the ** WARNING **:
+	gstplugin: registry needs rebuild warning to appear - sets a hidden
+	global in gstplugin.c to turn the warning off.	Fix a warning in
+	gst/cothreads.c (function was declared extern, defined static)
+
+2001-01-07 14:55  richardb
+
+	* plugins/esd/esdsink/esdsink.c: FIx a tiny memory leak.
+
+2001-01-07 14:49  wtay
+
+	* gst/elements/: gstqueue.c, gstqueue.h: Greatly simplyfied queue
+	locking by only using the elements mutex. This should fix the
+	locking problems we had...
+
+2001-01-07 14:32  richardb
+
+	* plugins/esd/esdsink/esdsink.c: And another tiny warning.
+
+2001-01-07 14:29  richardb
+
+	* plugins/esd/esdsink/esdsink.c: Fix a couple of warnings.
+
+2001-01-07 14:16  richardb

+	not to be installed.
+
+2001-01-07 14:05  richardb
+
+	* acinclude.m4: Add an acinclude containing AM_PATH_ALSA, so wtay
+	can compile.  Will shortly update this with a slightly better
+	macro.
+
+2001-01-07 13:58  richardb
+
+	* configure.in, docs/manuals.mak: Add tests for -L png and -L eps
+	arguments to fig2dev.  Correct slip in docs/manuals.mak which used
+	HAVE_DB2PS instead of HAVE_PS2PDF.
+
+2001-01-07 08:40  omegahacker
+
+	* configure.in: added check for libasound, and fixed check for
+	cdparanoia
+
+2001-01-07 08:01  omegahacker
+
+	* plugins/filters/ladspa/gstladspa.c: fixed a bug: in an
+	over-zealous attempt to squash leaks, I put the g_free too early
+
+2001-01-07 07:46  omegahacker
+
+	* plugins/filters/ladspa/: gstladspa.c, search.c: some leak fixes

+
+	* gst/: gstcaps.c, gstcpu.c, gstelementfactory.c, gstpad.c,

+
+2001-01-07 07:01  richardb
+
+	* gst/gstplugin.c, tools/gstreamer-register.c: Check plugin
+	repository up-to-dateness by scanning through all directories on
+	path, and checking that they and all their files are older than the
+	repository.  Give warning message if not.
+
+2001-01-07 05:54  richardb
+
+	* tools/gstreamer-register.c: Test xmlSaveFile return value
+	correctly (had to get source to find out what it meant...) 
+	gstreamer-register now seems to work fine, even in a non-standard
+	location.
+
+2001-01-07 05:35  richardb
+
+	* configure.in: Fix tiny slip which made configdir still always be
+	/etc/gstreamer/
+
+2001-01-07 05:30  richardb
+
+	* acconfig.h, configure.in, docs/manual/factories.sgml,

+	Cleaned up INFO system some more, added API to select categories,
+	modified the printout function to print cleanly for GST_INIT info
+	(the default min) and spew function:line debug_string [element] for

+	process is.
+	
+	2) Fixed a major bug with cothreads in threads.  Had to add
+	MAP_FIXED to the mmap() of the cothread stack.	Presumably the
+	gilbc that ships with redhat 7.0 now places these mmap requests
+	somewhat randomly.  Since they *must* be exactly where we expect

+	the scheduler.	Introduced the concept of chains, which are subsets
+	of the list of managed elements for a given manager bin, which get
+	scheduled as separate entities.  gst_bin_iterate_func should be
+	pretty much fixed now, the scheduling code gets to do all the hard
+	work.

+	
+	Whole lotta changes here, including a few random bits:
+	
+	examples/*/Makefile: updated to use `libtool gcc`, not just `gcc`
+	gst/   gstbuffer.h: updated to new flag style	gst.c, gstdebug.h:
+	added new debugging for function ptrs	gstpipeline.c: set type of
+	parent_class to the class, not the object   gstthread.c: ditto
+	plugins/   cdparanoia/cdparanoia.c: added an argument type, updated
+	some defaults	cobin/spindentity.c: updated to new do/while
+	loopfunction style   mp3encode/lame/gstlame.c: argument types,
+	whole lotta lame options tests/: various changes
+	
+	Now, for the big changes:  Once again, the scheduling system has
+	changed.  And once again, it broke a whole bunch of things.  The
+	gist of the change is that there is now a function pointer for
+	gst_pad_push and gst_pad_pull, instead of a hard-wired function. 
+	Well, currently they are functions, but that's for debugging
+	purposes only, they just call the function pointer after spewing
+	lots of DEBUG().
+	
+	This changed the GstPad structure a bit, and the GstPad API as
+	well.  Where elements used to provide chain() and pull() functions,
+	they provide chain() and get() functions.
+	gst_pad_set_pull[region]_function has been changed to
+	get_pad_set_get[region]_function.  This means all the elements out
+	there that used to have pull functions need to be updated.  The
+	calls to that function have been changed in the normal elements,
+	but the names of the functions passed is still _pull[region](),
+	which is an aesthetic issue more than anything.
+	
+	As for what doesn't work yet, just about anything dealing with
+	Connections is hosed, meaning threaded stuff won't work.  This will
+	be fixed about 12 hours from now, after I've slept, etc.  The
+	simplefake.c test works in both cothreaded and chained cases, but
+	not much else will work due to the Connection problem.	Needless to
+	say, don't grab this unless you *need* these features *now*, else
+	wait to update this stuff until tomorrow.
+	
+	I'm going to sleep now.

+	is very likely going to be ditched due to its complexity and the
+	fact that it doesn't work right now.  More than that, it's
+	generating some really odd results in my test program, which aren't
+	readily explainable.
+	
+	If you want to keep a working copy of your working copy (heh),
+	don't update until this is replaced with a hybrid approach.  This
+	approach will be the beginning of a plan generator that can
+	construct full hybrid schedules given hints from various places.
+	
+	Hybrid means that cothreads are used, but there are chunks of the
+	pipeline that are actually dealt with by chaining. This can improve
+	speed by reducing cothread switches (which are much cheaper than
+	thread switches, but still far from free, about 570 cycles on my
+	PIII), but does carry a complexity burden.  Luckily, the structure

+
+	* gst/: gstbin.c, gstconnection.c, gstconnection.h, gstdebug.h,
+	gstelement.c, gstpad.c, elements/gstqueue.c: Another big set of
+	changes.  Connections are now also pullfunc based.  gstqueue has
+	been updated, I don't know of any other connections offhand.
+	
+	There are still a few things that need doing, specifically the
+	concept of a source or connection with connections to multiple
+	thread contexts is not dealt with.  This may force us to move the
+	threadstate from the element to the pad, maybe keeping the
+	element's copy for simple cases.  Then the Bin would create a
+	structure to pass to the cothreaded _wrappers of any such elements,
+	which would detail the pads that are to be dealt with by this
+	particular cothread context.
+	
+	That will speed things up to, since we don't have to look through
+	the list of all pads for every Src or Connection element for every
+	iteration, we can simply step through the list provided by the
+	plan.  Special case might even have a single pad pointer sitting
+	there to trump the list, if there's only one (the common case
+	anyway).
+	
+	Task 23098 is tracking these changes.  The main task 22588 depends
+	on that subtask, as well as 22240, which is a consistency check on

+	elements/gstaudiosrc.c, elements/gstdisksrc.c,
+	elements/gstfakesrc.c, elements/gstfdsrc.c, elements/gsthttpsrc.c,
+	elements/gstsinesrc.c: Changed the way things are scheduled,
+	especially sources.  A Src used to have a push() function, and
+	optionally a pushregion() to deal with async reads, etc.  That
+	whole thing has gone away, in favor of providing a pull() function
+	for the output (Src) pad instead, ala chain functions.	This makes
+	constructing cothreaded schedules out of non-loop elements somewhat
+	easier.  Basically there was always a question as to which pad was
+	being dealt with.  In the pullregion case, cothread-specific data
+	was used to try to pass the region struct to the right place, which
+	is a slow hack.  And in general, the push function severely limited
+	the kind of tricks that could be played when there's more than one
+	output pad, such as a multi-out file reader with async capabilities
+	on each pad independently.
+	
+	This changes the way cothread scheduling occurs.  Instead of the
+	hack to deal with Src's by calling their push() function (or
+	optionally the pushregion(), in certain cases), we now are working
+	towards a general mechanism where pads are the only thing that are
+	dealt with directly.
+	
+	An optimization was made in the process of doing this: the
+	loopfunction actually run as the outer [stack] frame of the
+	cothread is now set more intelligently in create_plan() based on
+	what kind of element it is.  We now have:
+	
+	loopfunc_wrapper: used for loop-based elements, it simply calls the
+	    loopfunc in a loop, paying attention to COTHREAD_STOPPING (see 
+	below).  It currently does other, soon to be depracated, stuff.
+	
+	pullsrc_wrapper: wraps a Src that's not loop-based (since your
+	options  are now loop- or pull-based)
+	
+	There will be a couple more to deal with other cases, such as
+	Connections and chain-based elements.  The general idea is that
+	it's a lot more efficient to make the decisions once in create_plan
+	than to keep doing this huge if/else chain in the wrapper.  Just
+	choose the right wrapper up front.  It'll be most apparent
+	performance-wise in the case of whichever element context is
+	switched to first for each iteration, since the whole wrapper setup
+	is done for every iteration.
+	
+	The tricky part is that there is now a bit of overloading of the
+	function pointers in a pad.  The current meanings (possibly to
+	change a bit more soon) are:
+	
+	chainfunc: as always, chainfunc pointer is mirrored between peer
+	pads		(this may change, and the chain func may end up in
+	pushfunc) pushfunc: SrcPad: gst_pad_pushfunc_proxy, cothread_switch
+	to peer 	  SinkPad: none (may take over chainfunc, see
+	below) pullfunc: SrcPad: Src or Connection's function to construct
+	buffers 	  SinkPad: gst_pad_pullfunc_proxy, cothread_switch
+	to peer
+	
+	There are a number of issues remaining with the scheduling, not the
+	least of which is the fact that Connections are still dealt with
+	the old way, with _push() functions and such.  I'm trying to figure
+	out a way to unify the system so it makes sense.  Following the
+	scheduling system is hard enough, trying to change it is murder.
+	
+	Another useful scheduling addition, mentioned above, is
+	COTHREAD_STOPPING.  It's an element flag that's used to signal
+	whatever code is running in cothread context that it should be
+	finishing up and exiting soon.	An example of this is in
+	plugins/cobin/spindentity.c.  All the loops should now be composed
+	of do/while loops, rather than while(1) loops:
+	
+	  do {
+	    buf = gst_pad_pull(spindentity->sinkpad);
+	    gst_pad_push(spindentity->srcpad,buf);
+	  } while (!GST_ELEMENT_IS_COTHREAD_STOPPING(element));
+	
+	The reason for this is that COTHREAD_STOPPING may be set before the
+	above loop ever gets started.  It wouldn't do for the body of the
+	loop to never once get called, that would simply stall the
+	pipeline. Note that only the core library code is ever responsible
+	for setting and unsetting this flag.  All elements have to do is
+	respond to it by cleanly exiting the loop and the function holding
+	it.
+	
+	This is needed primarily to allow iterations to occur properly. 
+	Basically, there's a single entry point in the cothread scheduling
+	loop, gst_bin_iterate_func() simply switches to this cothread.	If
+	the element in this context is allowed to loop infinitely, nothing
+	would even switch back to the context from which the iterate() was
+	originally called.  This is a bit of a problem.  The solution is
+	for there to be an implicit switch back to the originating context.
+	 Now, even I'm not sure exactly how this works, but if the cothread
+	that's switched to actually returns, execution returns back to the
+	calling context, i.e. iterate_func().
+	
+	COTHREAD_STOPPING is therefore set just before switching into this
+	(currently randomly chosen) context, on the assumption that it will
+	return promptly after finishing its duties.  The burden of clearing
+	the flag falls to the various wrapper functions provided by the Bin
+	code, thus element writers don't have to worry about doing that at
+	all (and simply shouldn't).
+	
+	Related changes: All the sources in elements/ have been changed to
+	reflect the new system.
+	
+	FIXMEs: 1) gstpipeline.c calls gst_src_push at some point, dunno
+	why, it's commented out now.  2) any other sources, including
+	vcdsrc, dvdsrc, and v4lsrc will break badly and need to be modified
+	to work as pull-based sources.
+

+
+	* acconfig.h, configure.in, gst/Makefile.am, gst/cothreads.c,
+	gst/gst.h, gst/gstbuffer.c, gst/gstdebug.h: Changes made to the
+	DEBUG system.  New header file gstdebug.h holds the stuff to keep
+	it out of gst.h's hair.  DEBUG prints out the process id, cothread
+	id, source filename and line number.  Two new macros DEBUG_ENTER
+	and DEBUG_LEAVE are used to show the entry and exit of a given
+	function.  This eventually might be used to construct call trace
+	graphs, even taking cothreads into account.  This would be quite
+	useful in visualizing the scheduling mechanism.
+	
+	Minor changes to various debug messages.
+	
+	Also sitting in gstdebug.h is a prototypical DEBUG_ENTER that's
+	capable of performing DEBUG_LEAVE automatically.  It does this by
+	utilizing a little-known GCC extension that allows one to call a
+	function with the same parameters as the current function.  The
+	macro uses this to basically call itself.  A boolean is used to
+	ensure that when it calls itself it actually runs the body of the
+	function.  In the meantime it prints stuff out before and after the
+	real function, as well as constructing a debugging string.  This
+	can be used eventually to provide call-wide data on the DEBUG
+	lines, instead of having to replicate data on each call to DEBUG. 
+	More research is needed into how this would most cleanly be fit
+	into some other chunk of code, like GStreamer (I think of this
+	DEBUG trick as a separate project, sorta).
+	
+	Unfortunately, the aforementioned DEBUG trick interacts quite
+	poorly with cothreads.	Almost any time it's used in a function
+	that has anything remotely to do with a cothread context (as in, it
+	runs in one), a segfault results from the __builtin_apply call,
+	which is the heart of the whole thing.	If someone who really knows
+	assembly could analyze the resulting code to see what's really
+	going on, we might find a way to fix either the macro or the
+	cothreads (I'm thinking that there's something we missed in
+	constructing the cothreads themselves) so this works in all cases.
+	
+	In the meantime, please insert both DEBUG_ENTER and DEBUG_LEAVE in
+	your functions.  Be sure to put DEBUG_ENTER after your variable
+	declarations and before any functional code, not to put the
+	function name in any DEBUG strings (it's already there, trust me),
+	and put a DEBUG_LEAVE if you care enough.
+	
+	Changes are going to happen in the way DEBUGs and other printouts
+	occur, so stay tuned.

+	so they can be responsible for exitting the loopfunc itself
+	appropriately.
+	
+	The loopfunc_wrapper function has been changed to call the loopfunc

+
+	* plugins/mp3decode/mpg123/: common.c, getbits.c, getbits.h,

+
+	* plugins/mp3decode/: mpg123/gstmpg123.c, parse/mp3parse.c: Fixed

+
+2000-02-05 01:20  wtay
+
+	* plugins/mp3decode/parse/mp3parse.c, test/a.c, test/mp3parse.c,
+	test/mp3play.c: Fixed a nasty bug in mp3parse (partial buffer state
+	remained) Added eos check for the test programs to stop them from
+	allocating all of your memory (had to use alt-sysreq-k a few times
+	:-( ).	MPEG layer 1 plays fine now with mp3play.
+
+2000-02-04 23:27  wtay
+
+	* plugins/mp3decode/mpg123/: getbits.c, test.c: Tested with layer 1

+
+	* plugins/mp3decode/mpg123/: common.c, getbits.c, getbits.h,

+	working. Tried with the test program included.	Still some errors
+	and clicks sometime, but you can hear something.  Double buffering
+	is now used (like mpg123). Can somebody test this on a layer 1 or 2
+	stream (I have none) and together with the mp3parse?
+
+2000-02-04 21:49  omegahacker

+	managed to mutilate it a while back, but now it's fixed.  I'll put
+	a copy of the HTML output somewhere on the website tonight.
+	
+	In order to actually generate the docs, you'll have to install all
+	the DocBook tools, as well as gtk-doc from GNOME cvs.  (see
+	http://developer.gnome.org/arch/doc/tools.html)
+	
+	Notes (I'll codify these some day):
+	
+	- Don't believe the Gnome page, always edit the SOURCES when
+	documenting a given function, never the tmpl file.  - I'll be
+	re-arranging things a lot, but gtk-doc is smart enough to merge any
+	changes to the tmpl file.  However, gtk-doc's merge and CVS's diff
+	are two entirely separate animals.  We should probably have a
+	virtual mutex on the entire docs/gst/ directory, over and above
+	what CVS does.	- I'm going to try to end up with a book set
+	(docbook terms), where docs/gst/ is only one book.  There'd be
+	another called docs/manual/, and another docs/plugins/, etc.  If
+	you have any comments as to how these should be done,
+	gstreamer-devel is the place.

+	configuration specifiable on configure commandline.  Make detection
+	of atomic resource stuff cope with 2.0 linux kernels.  Fix typo
+	(HAVE_ATOMIC_T for HAVE_ATOMIC_H).  Remove generated ltmain.sh file

+
+	* plugins/rtjpeg/: RTjpeg.c, RTjpeg.h: Added MMX optimised DCT and

+	version is not compatible with the regular RTjpeg due to

+	
+	The RTjpeg.[ch] code is taken from a just-downloaded copy from
+	Justin's site, with some fixes (#include <asm/types.h> to get
+	__u64,etc).  Once the aforementioned infrastructure is in place,
+	the elements can actually be set up to do the encode/decode, and

+The elementfactory for a given element will contain some information about the capabilities of element's
+pads or potential pads.  An indication will be provided as to whether the pad always exists, always
+exists once data is present, or *might* exist once data is present (the latter case is for things like
+the MPEG system parsers, where an audio stream might or might not exist).
+
+
+First, an entirely normal example:
+----------------------------------
+
+(-----------)        (----------)        (-------------)
+! disksrc   !        ! mpg123   !        ! audiosink   !
+!         src        sink     src        sink          !
+!           !        !          !        !             !
+(-----------)        (----------)        (-------------)
+
+We start with only the disksrc.  The typefind filter is attached to the disksrc, and via typefind magic
+the properties of the disksrc are found to be:
+
+  disksrc->src->caps = {
+    "audio/mp3",
+    "layer",   GST_CAPS_INT (3),
+    "bitrate", GST_CAPS_INT (128),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+A look through the plugin registry shows that we have an element called mpg123 that has the following
+caps:
+
+  static GstCapsFactory mpg123_sink_caps = {
+    "audio/mp3",
+    "layer",   GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (1, 3),
+    "bitrate", GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (8, 320),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+The caps of the disksrc fit within those parameters, so we instantiate an mpg123 and attach it to the
+disksrc.  The connection succeeds negotiation and as a result the mpg123 specifies its output caps as:
+
+  mpg123->src->caps = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "format",   GST_CAPS_BITFIELD (S16),
+    "depth",    GST_CAPS_INT (16),
+    "rate",     GST_CAPS_INT (44100),
+    "channels", GST_CAPS_INT (2),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+Again from the plugin registry we find an element audiosink that has appropriate caps:
+
+  static GstCapsFactory audiosink_src_caps = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "format",   GST_CAPS_BITFIELD (S16,....),
+    "depth",    GST_CAPS_INT (16),
+    "rate",     GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (4000, 96000),
+    "channels", GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (1, 2),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+A copy of the audiosink is instantiated and attached, negotiation goes smoothly, and we're done.  No
+dataflow has occured, no failure found, etc.  An ideal autoplug.
+
+
+Now, a slightly more convoluted example:
+----------------------------------------
+
+Start with the same graph:
+
+(-----------)        (----------)        (-------------)
+! disksrc   !        ! mpg123   !        ! audiosink   !
+!         src        sink     src        sink          !
+!           !        !          !        !             !
+(-----------)        (----------)        (-------------)
+
+Run typefind on the disksrc's output, get the same output caps:
+
+  disksrc->src->caps = {
+    "audio/mp3",
+    "layer",   GST_CAPS_INT (3),
+    "bitrate", GST_CAPS_INT (128),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+Find and attach mpg123, get the following output caps this time:
+
+  mpg123->src->caps = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "format",   GST_CAPS_BITFIELD (S16),
+    "depth",    GST_CAPS_INT (16),
+    "rate",     GST_CAPS_INT (44100),
+    "channels", GST_CAPS_INT (1),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+Note that this time we have a mono output.  A look into the audiosink caps shows that we have a match.
+So we instantiate a copy.  Oops.  We now find that the caps for the input pad on our audiosink have
+changed:
+
+  mpg123->src->caps = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "format",   GST_CAPS_BITFIELD (S16,...),
+    "depth",    GST_CAPS_INT (16),
+    "rate",     GST_CAPS_INT (11025, 48000),
+    "channels", GST_CAPS_INT (2),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+Whoops.  It seems that the sound card we've got in this machine (FIXME how on earth to deal with
+multiple sound cards???) doesn't support mono output *at all*.  This is a problem.  We now find that we
+hae no options as far as directly matching the mpg123 to the audiosink.
+
+A look through our (ficticious) plugin registry shows at least one element that at least has audio/raw
+on both input and ouput (since both mpg123 and audiosink have open pads with this mime type).  A closerlook shows that its caps are:
+
+  static GstCapsFactory mono2stereo_sink_caps = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "channels", GST_CAPS_INT (1),
+    NULL
+  };
+  static GstCapsFactory mono2stereo_src_caps = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "channels", GST_CAPS_INT (2),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+Wow, that's a perfect match.  Instantiate, attach to mpg123, no problems.  Attach to audiosink, no
+problems.  Done.  When we start up the pipeline, we should get absolutely no callbacks from pads saying
+"help me, I've fallen and..., er, I don't like this buffer!".
+
+
+A really messy case:
+--------------------
+
+Start with a disksrc, typefind it, get the following:
+
+  disksrc->src->caps = {
+    "audio/mp3",
+    "layer",   GST_CAPS_INT (3),
+    "bitrate", GST_CAPS_INT (128),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+Look through the plugin registry, find mpg123.  Instantiate it, attach it.  It spits out audio
+parameters as usual:
+
+  mpg123->src->caps = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "format",   GST_CAPS_BITFIELD (S16),
+    "depth",    GST_CAPS_INT (16),
+    "rate",     GST_CAPS_INT (44100),
+    "channels", GST_CAPS_INT (2),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+Now we instantiate an audiosink plugin.  This time, we're sunk:
+
+  mpg123->src->caps = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "format",   GST_CAPS_BITFIELD (S8,U8),
+    "depth",    GST_CAPS_INT (8),
+    "rate",     GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (11025, 22050),
+    "channels", GST_CAPS_INT (1),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+ACK!  It's one of those Disney Sound Source things.  We've got a problem here that isn't obviously
+solvable.  However, there happens to be another mp3 decoder sitting around.  It's got the same
+properties as mpg123, but a lower merit value.  Let's instantiate one and attach it.  We get the
+following output pad caps:
+
+  mp3decoder->src->caps = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "format",   GST_CAPS_BITFIELD (S8,S16),
+    "depth",    GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (8,16),
+    "rate",     GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (8000, 44100),
+    "channels", GST_CAPS_INT (1,2),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+Well, that matches the audiosink.  We try attaching it, and during negotiation the mp3decoder finds
+sufficient common ground with the castrated audiosink and sets its output pad to match the best of the
+options: S8 at 22050 KHz.
+
+
+
+Next to impossible scenario: DVD
+--------------------------------
+
+Start with a dvdsrc.  It's output pad caps are:
+
+  static GstCapsFactory dvdsrc_src_caps = {
+    "video/mpeg",
+    "mpegversion",  GST_CAPS_INT (2),
+    "systemstream", GST_CAPS_BOOLEAN (TRUE),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+The type would be classified as incomplete via some mechanism.  This might cause the autoplug code to go
+and run the typefind function.  It would flesh the type out to the following:
+
+  dvdsrc->src->caps = {
+    "video/mpeg",
+    "mpegversion",  GST_CAPS_INT (2),
+    "systemstream", GST_CAPS_BOOLEAN (TRUE),
+    "videostreams", GST_CAPS_INT (1),
+    "audiostreams", GST_CAPS_INT (3),
+    "bitrate",      GST_CAPS_INT (40960),
+    NULL,
+  };
+
+Wow, that helped a lot.  A check through the plugin registry shows that the mpeg2parse will match those
+properties:
+
+  static GstCapsFactory mpeg2parse_sink_caps = {
+    "video/mpeg",
+    "mpegversion",  GST_CAPS_INT (2),
+    "systemstream", GST_CAPS_BOOLEAN (TRUE),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+(In retrospect, it may not be necessary to run typefind if there's match this good right away.  Only run
+typefind when there's no exact match.)
+Since there are no output pads yet, we have to actually push data through the pipeline.  The moment a
+buffer or two get to the mpeg2parse element, it promptly goes and creates an output pad, probably of the
+following caps:
+
+  mpeg2parse_video_src_caps = {
+    "video/mpeg",
+    "mpegversion",  GST_CAPS_RANGE (1,2),
+    "systemstream", GST_CAPS_BOOLEAN (FALSE),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+This seems to be a task for typefind again.  But since data is flowing, we have to be careful with the
+buffers.  (This is the case in any typefind maneuver, but moreso when one really can't rewind the
+source without consequences)  The autoplug system attaches a special pseudo-element to mpeg2parse's new
+output pad, and attaches the typefind element to the end of that.  The pseudo-element takes the buffer,
+stores it, and passes a copy off to the attached element, in this case typefind.  This repeats until
+typefind has determined the type, at which point the typefind is removed, and the newly found element is
+attached instead.
+
+The pseudo-element is 'rewound' and the stored buffers flow out and into the newly attached element.
+When the cache of buffers is gone, a signal fires and the autoplug system removes the pseudo-element and
+reconnects the pipeline.
+
+In this case, the typefind function will find the following:
+
+  mpeg2parse_video_src_caps = {
+    "video/mpeg",
+    "mpegversion",  GST_CAPS_INT (2),
+    "systemstream", GST_CAPS_BOOLEAN (FALSE),
+    "bitrate",      GST_CAPS_INT (36864),
+    "width",        GST_CAPS_INT (720),
+    "height",       GST_CAPS_INT (480),
+    "framerate",    GST_CAPS_FLOAT (29.97002997),
+    "chromaformat", GST_CAPS_INT (1),		[GST_CAPS_STRING ("4:2:0") ?]
+    NULL
+  };
+
+Back to the plugin registry, we find our only choice is mpeg2dec, which has input caps of:
+
+  static GstCapsFactory mpeg2dec_sink_caps = {
+    "video/mpeg",
+    "mpegversion",  GST_CAPS_RANGE (1,2),
+    "systemstream", GST_CAPS_BOOLEAN (FALSE),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+Once again it just so happens that we really didn't need to do the typefind at all.  But it can't hurt
+unless the typefind is slow and painful, which we can guess won't be the case since the choices are
+rather limited by the fact that there's already a MIME type attached, meaning we can drastically reduce
+the number of typefind functions we try (down to one, actually).
+
+However, since we *have* run the typefind, upon attachment of the input pad of mpeg2dec, the output pad
+looks like the following:
+
+  mpeg2dec_src_caps = {
+    "video/raw",
+    "fourcc",    GST_CAPS_LIST (
+			GST_CAPS_FOURCC ("YV12"),	[identical...]
+			GST_CAPS_FOURCC ("IYUV"),
+			GST_CAPS_FOURCC ("I420"),
+                 ),
+    "width",     GST_CAPS_INT (720),
+    "height",    GST_CAPS_INT (480),
+    "framerate", GST_CAPS_FLOAT (29.97002997),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+Currently only videosink supports the output of video/raw.  It claims a list of FOURCCs but nothing
+more:
+
+  static GstCapsFactory videosink_sink_caps = {
+    "video/raw",
+    "fourcc", GST_CAP_LIST ( GST_CAPS_FOURCC ("YV12"),
+		GST_CAPS_FOURCC ("IYUV"), GST_CAPS_FOURCC ("I420"),
+		GST_CAPS_FOURCC ("YUY2"), GST_CAPS_FOURCC ("UYVY"),
+		[ etc... ],
+              ),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+When instantiated, we potentially have the same problem as with the audiosink: we don't necessarily know
+which hardware output to use.  Somehow we have to solve the problem of setting some element arguments
+before we can get useful information out of them as to the properties.  In this case anyway, if the
+videosink were to find only one output possibility, it would trim the list of FOURCCs it can deal with
+to what the hardware can handle, as well as add further properties:
+
+  videosink_sink_caps = {
+    "video/raw",
+    "fourcc", GST_CAPS_LIST (GST_CAPS_FOURCC ("YV12"),
+			GST_CAPS_FOURCC ("YUY2"),
+              ),
+    "width",  GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (4,1020),
+    "height", GST_CAPS_INT_RANGE (4,1020),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+We can now connect the mpeg2dec output to the videosink, and we now have displaying video.

+Changes made to the DEBUG system.  New header file gstdebug.h holds the stuff to keep it out of gst.h's
+hair.  DEBUG prints out the process id, cothread id, source filename and line number.  Two new macros
+DEBUG_ENTER and DEBUG_LEAVE are used to show the entry and exit of a given function.  This eventually
+might be used to construct call trace graphs, even taking cothreads into account.  This would be quite
+useful in visualizing the scheduling mechanism.
+
+Minor changes to various debug messages.
+
+Also sitting in gstdebug.h is a prototypical DEBUG_ENTER that's capable of performing DEBUG_LEAVE
+automatically.  It does this by utilizing a little-known GCC extension that allows one to call a
+function with the same parameters as the current function.  The macro uses this to basically call
+itself.  A boolean is used to ensure that when it calls itself it actually runs the body of the
+function.  In the meantime it prints stuff out before and after the real function, as well as
+constructing a debugging string.  This can be used eventually to provide call-wide data on the DEBUG
+lines, instead of having to replicate data on each call to DEBUG.  More research is needed into how this
+would most cleanly be fit into some other chunk of code, like GStreamer (I think of this DEBUG trick as
+a separate project, sorta).
+
+Unfortunately, the aforementioned DEBUG trick interacts quite poorly with cothreads.  Almost any time
+it's used in a function that has anything remotely to do with a cothread context (as in, it runs in
+one), a segfault results from the __builtin_apply call, which is the heart of the whole thing.  If
+someone who really knows assembly could analyze the resulting code to see what's really going on, we
+might find a way to fix either the macro or the cothreads (I'm thinking that there's something we missed
+in constructing the cothreads themselves) so this works in all cases.
+
+In the meantime, please insert both DEBUG_ENTER and DEBUG_LEAVE in your functions.  Be sure to put
+DEBUG_ENTER after your variable declarations and before any functional code, not to put the function
+name in any DEBUG strings (it's already there, trust me), and put a DEBUG_LEAVE if you care enough.
+
+Changes are going to happen in the way DEBUGs and other printouts occur, so stay tuned.

+OUTDATED
+--------
+
+
+What I propose for EOS condition is th following:  As is stands, EOS is a
+flag in a buffer.  However, it's also a signal from an element, which is
+odd. What I propose is that EOS become a pad thing.  Here's how it would
+work:
+
+When a source has a final buffer, it marks it as EOS.  It passes this on
+through the pad, and the pads set a 'pending' EOS state on the way
+through.  When another push or pull happens, only then does the pad signal
+EOS.  This means that EOS doesn't happen until the buffer has passed all
+the way to the end, and a request for another buffer is starting to work
+its way back.  It gets stopped almost immediately.
+
+This gets a bit messy in complex cases, haven't thought them all out.
+Assuming everything is reasonably symmetric, it should work out cleanly.
+We may have to add the ability to force buffers to pass even post EOS, but
+that sounds like a hack.
+
+

+When dvdsrc reads its last buffer, it sets EOS on the buffer and passes it.  The pad (probably audio1,
+since video and audio are interleaved and subtitles don't usually end up at the end of a movie) would
+set EOS pending, and pass it to mpeg2dec which would pass the EOS to the merge.  Merge would then ask
+for a buffer from subtitle1, since that's the one we're showing subtitles on right now.  It would then
+pull from the mpeg2parse.  This would cause a switch back the parser, who's next task is to go and set
+all the output pads to EOS.  It may have to accomplish this by sending a zero-byte buffer.
+
+Well, this example isn't actually very good.  I'll go ahead and implement it, and we can see what
+happens.  The current setup is so lacking that anything is better....

+g_return_...
+============
+The parameters of a function are checked for validity (non-NULL, correct type, etc.) with g_return[_val]_if_fail, i.e.:

+gst_element_connect (GstElement *src, gchar *srcpadname,
+                     GstElement *dest, gchar *destpadname) {

+OUTDATED, EARLY IDEA
+--------------------
+
+When two pads are connected, a negotiation phase is going to have to
+happen.  Ideally, the caps of the two pads will both be fully-specified,
+and match.  That's the ideal case, but may rarely happen in practice.
+
+It'll work the following way:
+
+1) gst_pad_connect(pad1,pad2) is called by something
+2) pad1's negotiate() method is called, with pad2 as argument
+3) negotiate() repeatedly calls pad2's set_caps() method
+
+At some point, the two pads will agree on a set of caps, and proceed by
+returning TRUE from negotiate(), at which point gst_pad_connect()
+finishes.  If it returns FALSE, gst_pad_connect() is forced to fail.
+
+Now, obviously the algorithm used to find matching caps can get
+complicated.  But in some cases it'll be simple.  Ideally, if there is no
+negotiate() function for pad1, there'll be a function that will go through
+the options and try to make pad1 and pad2 meet in the middle, with no
+specific knowledge of what the caps actually mean.
+
+Another detail is deciding which pads are pad1 and pad2.  In the autoplug
+case, the code will sometimes know which of the pads have the more
+specific caps.  In others, you may not.  Either you can guess, and
+possibly lose to having the slower of the two pad's negotiate() methods do
+the work, or you might be able to actually guess at which is the most
+specific set of caps:
+
+For any given typeid in the union of both pads, look at all properties
+  For each property, find the smallest range, assign this a 1.0
+    For all other instances of this property, assign relative to 1.0
+For each pad1,pad2
+  Take the assigned value of every property, and multiply together
+
+Whichever value is lower between pad1 and pad2 is most likely to be the
+most specific set of caps.  The trick is implementing the above
+efficiently, but on the surface there appear to be more than enough
+potential optimizations.

+OUTDATED
+--------
+
+Plan generation happens at transition from NULL to READY (and PLAYING to READY right now, need to fix
+that).  By way of some logic in gst_bin_change_state(), gst_bin_create_plan() is only called for the
+outer Bin, usually a Pipeline.  This keeps things from getting nasty later on.
+
+A major new concept in plan generation is that of the 'manager'.  This is the element that is reponsible
+for running a given element.  In general, Pipelines and Threads are the only managing-capable elements
+(have the MANAGER flag set), since they are the only ones with real scheduling authority (because they
+have a process context to play with, basically).
+
+gst_bin_set_manager() is called to set the manager element of the bin and all it's children and their
+children.  However, there's one important trick: it won't recurse into child Bins that have the MANAGER
+flag set.  This avoids some highly redundant recursion.
+
+When create_plan() is called on the outside Pipeline, the first thing it does is call
+set_manager(self,self).  As noted above, this recursion will not proceed into child Bins that have the
+MANAGER flag set.
+
+The next step is to recursively generate the plan (yes, head-recursive).  This gives child Bins the
+opportunity to generate their plan first, causing a inside-to-outside sequence.  This matches the way
+the scheduling is arranged now, where the plan for a Src/Connection outside a Bin is handled by that
+Bin, not it's parent.  But we must be very careful not to stomp on that plan in the parent Bin.
+
+Because create_plan() is called on all Bins, but we can only set up scheduling state in MANAGER bins,
+create_plan() must perform create_plan() recursion, but not do anything else *unless* the MANAGER bit is
+set.  It shouldn't even call set_manager() unless it's a MANAGER itself, because calling it otherwise
+would waste time doing the work again.  Basically, from the standpoing of setting the manager,
+create_plan() recursion starts it when the current Bin is a MANAGER, and set_manager() stops when it
+finds the next one.  create_plan()'s further recursion eventually starts the process back up again
+furtuer down the hierarchy, until everything is covered.
+
+For all MANAGER Bins, the last step is to actually create the scheduling plan.  This is still one of the
+nastiest chunks of code in the whole project, and probably will do nothing but get worse from now on (it
+got better recently, but only because I took a chainsaw to the code and broke everthing...).  It will
+remain similar to what it is now, but with some definite differences.
+
+First task is now to find all the elements that we're responsible for.  This is normally a recursive
+process, because the structure is an arbitrary tree.  However, something like the following should work 
+(bin is self):
+
+  GSList *elements = NULL;
+  GList *children;
+  GSList *waiting_bins = NULL;
+  GstBin *waiting_bin;
+
+  waiting_bins = g_slist_prepend (waiting_bins,bin);
+
+  while (waiting_bins) {
+    // retrieve the top of the stack and pop it
+    waiting_bin = GST_BIN (waiting_bins->data);
+    waiting_bins = g_slist_remove (waiting_bins,waiting_bin);
+
+    // walk the list of elements, and find bins
+    children = waiting_bin->children;
+    while (children) {
+      // add it to the list of elements
+      elements = g_slist_prepend (elements, children->data);
+
+      // if it's a bin and it's not a managing bin,
+      // shove it on the list of bins to recurse into
+      if (GST_IS_BIN (children->data) && 
+          !GST_FLAG_IS_SET (GST_ELEMENT (children->data)))
+        waiting_bins = g_slist_prepend (waiting_bins,children->data);
+
+      children = g_list_next (children);
+    }
+  }
+
+The code makes the assumption that the manager of every element is the same until such time as a
+different managing parent appears in the hierarchy.  This is the result of the aforementioned nested
+recursion of create_plan() and set_manager(), but may not remain the case forever.  The above loop
+should probably be slightly re-written to work solely on whether or not the Bin in question is the
+element's manager.  This means that the child Bins are *always* recursed into, in case there's a rogue
+element inside of one of them that's supposed to be managed.
+
+At the same time all the elements managed by this bin are found (i.e. in the inner loop), we can
+determine some useful bits of information, such as testing for several cases that require the use of
+cothreads.  The availability of manager information at this point may aid significantly in this
+decision.
+
+Finally, the scheduling plan is generated, based on all the elements to be managed by the Bin (the list
+of which may span several 'generations' of Bins and elements).  Elements which have peers in child
+self-managed Bins are left alone on for the pad in that makes that connection.  This should keep the
+parent Bins from stepping all over state set up by the child Bins, by establishing clear implicit
+ownership on the pad level, based on the managing Bins' relationship to the pad.

+A new concept in scheduling is that of chains of elements that need to be schedule separately, even in the same set of
+managed elements (which is the set of elements that the Bin in question [a pipeline or thread] is responsible for).  
+An example would by anywhere you have a non-blocking queue in place for buffering.  This kind of element might be
+useful in cases where the scheduling on a buffer level is tight enough that deadlocks might occur.
+
+The scheduler will find chains by traversing the pipeline through the list of managed elements.  A chain boundary is 
+anywhere you have a 'DECOUPLED' element.  A DECOUPLED element is one where there is no direct correlation between the 
+activities of the various pads.  A source fits this description, although the normal single-pad source is the 
+degenerate case.  A queue more properly fits the bill, since pushing a buffer at the sink pad doesn't trigger anything 
+on the src pad, and vice versa.  A multi-src async source is probably the best example, since you want to leave the 
+scheduling up to the elements connected to it.
+
+Anyway, first the simple case:
+
+fakesrc -> fakesink
+
+Both of them should probably have the DECOUPLED bit set, at least to be true to the nature of the actual fake elements.  
+These two end up being a chain, and scheduling has to be set up for the chain.  There are no cothreaded elements in the 
+chain, which means it's relatively easy.  The goal is to find a single entry into the chain, which can be called in a 
+loop to get things done.  Since the fakesrc is DECOUPLED, and we'd be messing with the source pad, it has lower 
+priority than a DECOUPLED sink pad, so the fakesrc's sink pad is the ideal entry into the chain.  This can be 
+simplified into saying that the fakesink is the entry.
+
+In the end, the code to do this boils down to:
+
+  buf = gst_pad_pull (fakesink->sinkpad);
+  gst_pad_push (fakesink->sinkpad, buf);
+
+Because of the way things are no implemented for scheduling, turning it around and making the source the entry has no
+effect as far as the efficiency.  That's because _get no longer directly calls gst_pad_push(), so we have to do it
+outside.  No big deal, it boils down to the same thing I think, modulo a cache-line of stack (i.e. one or two fewer
+this way).
+
+If we put an identity in the middle:
+
+fakesrc -> identity -> fakesink
+
+then we have the same thing, except that there's now an element that isn't DECOUPLED, so it gets higher priority.  That 
+means the identity is now the entry, and when we push the buffer into its chain function, the fakesink gets called.
+
+Now, we can make this much more complex, with the following elementary echo meta-filter:
+
+            |=====| -> delay1 -> |=====|
+            |     |              |     |
+-> queue -> | tee | -> delay2 -> | mix | -> queue ->
+            |     |              |     |
+            |=====| -> delay3 -> |=====|
+
+The tee takes a buffer in and spits three out, delay shifts the timestamps around and possibly reframes things to be 
+friendly.  mix takes the three buffers and simply sums them (they're all audio).  The tee element takes one buffer in 
+and promptly spits three out, one after another.  Delay takes an element and immediately spits out a buffer (it 
+zero-pads at the beginning [the duration of the delay] for the sake of argument).  Mix in this case is chained, but 
+assumes that buffer will arrive in order.  On the last chain, it does a push of the newly mixed audio buffer.
+
+The queues are both DECOUPLED, so they have lower weight.  That leaves a bunch of other elements sitting there ripe for 
+entry.  But if we were to take delay1, what would happen?  Well we can't, since there's no _get function on the tee's 
+src pads.
+
+This just re-enforces the idea that the left-most (closest to the source, for you right-to-left people) element should 
+get to be the entry.  But what if we have multiple left-most elements?:
+
+-> queue -> eq1 -> |=====|
+                   | mix | -> queue
+-> queue -> eq2 -> |=====|
+
+If eq1 is the only entry, we call pull on the queue, then chain over to mix.  Mix then doesn't do anything with it, 
+since it's waiting for another buffer before doing anything.  That means we have to do the same with eq2, and have it 
+chain to mix, at which point mix will do its magic and chain out to the right-hand side.  Figure out to actually use 
+both entries is hard, because the idea at this point is that there's only a single entry to a chain.
+
+Does this mean that we should make mix a DECOUPLED element?  That would fix it to some extent, giving us three chains 
+in the above case.  Each eq chain would be driven by the eq element, pulling from the queue and pushing into the mixer.  
+The mixer -> queue chain is problematic, because there is no possibly entry.  The mixer side has no _get function 
+(since the push always happens upon the receipt of a buffer from the second sink pad), which means that that those two 
+pads have no possible entrance.
+
+Cothreads make this case much easier, since the mix element would drive things, forcing the eq elements to pull and 
+process buffers in order as needed.  It may be that the best option in the case where there are any multi-sinkpad 
+elements is to turn them into cothreads.
+
+
+Now, on to cothreaded cases.  The simplest possible is to turn all the elements into cothreads.  I may punt on this and 
+do just that for the moment, but there's still the question of what to do at the ends of the chain, where the DECOUPLED 
+elements are.  The easiest is to simply always make then chained, so there's never any worry about who owns the 
+cothread context for the element, simply because there never will be one.
+
+fakesrc -> queue -> @identity -> fakesink
+
+We just set it up so both ends of the queue are chained, and all is well.

+Currently, when an element wants to push or pull, they call gst_pad_*.  These functions then decide what
+to do based on the selection of pointers in the pad.  There are at least 2 options for each, plus some
+header stuff to do various checking of flags.  Unfortunately, because of the selection of pointers in
+the pad, there is at least one case where scheduling has to be tricked, by providing a pointer to a
+function with no body.
+
+What I propse is that these functionos be replaced with macros that call a function pointer directly.
+The default functions (provided by GstPad) would be capable of chaining, that's about it.  When a
+schedule is formed, these get replaced with more specific functions, provided by GstBin or a subclass.
+
+In the chain case, the pad_push_func might even be replaced brute force with the chain function, since

+STATUS: pushregion/pullregion is gone
+-------------------------------------
+
+Changed the way things are scheduled, especially sources.  A Src used to
+have a push() function, and optionally a pushregion() to deal with async
+reads, etc.  That whole thing has gone away, in favor of providing a
+pull() function for the output (Src) pad instead, ala chain functions.  
+This makes constructing cothreaded schedules out of non-loop elements
+somewhat easier.  Basically there was always a question as to which pad
+was being dealt with.  In the pullregion case, cothread-specific data was
+used to try to pass the region struct to the right place, which is a slow
+hack.  And in general, the push function severely limited the kind of
+tricks that could be played when there's more than one output pad, such as
+a multi-out file reader with async capabilities on each pad independently.
+
+This changes the way cothread scheduling occurs.  Instead of the hack to
+deal with Src's by calling their push() function (or optionally the
+pushregion(), in certain cases), we now are working towards a general
+mechanism where pads are the only thing that are dealt with directly.
+
+An optimization was made in the process of doing this: the loopfunction
+actually run as the outer [stack] frame of the cothread is now set more
+intelligently in create_plan() based on what kind of element it is.  We
+now have:
+
+loopfunc_wrapper: used for loop-based elements, it simply calls the
+	loopfunc in a loop, paying attention to COTHREAD_STOPPING (see
+	below).  It currently does other, soon to be depracated, stuff.
+
+pullsrc_wrapper: wraps a Src that's not loop-based (since your options
+	are now loop- or pull-based)
+
+There will be a couple more to deal with other cases, such as Connections
+and chain-based elements.  The general idea is that it's a lot more
+efficient to make the decisions once in create_plan than to keep doing
+this huge if/else chain in the wrapper.  Just choose the right wrapper up
+front.  It'll be most apparent performance-wise in the case of whichever
+element context is switched to first for each iteration, since the whole
+wrapper setup is done for every iteration.
+
+The tricky part is that there is now a bit of overloading of the function
+pointers in a pad.  The current meanings (possibly to change a bit more
+soon) are:
+
+chainfunc: as always, chainfunc pointer is mirrored between peer pads
+           (this may change, and the chain func may end up in pushfunc)
+pushfunc: SrcPad: gst_pad_pushfunc_proxy, cothread_switch to peer
+          SinkPad: none (may take over chainfunc, see below) pullfunc:
+SrcPad: Src or Connection's function to construct buffers
+          SinkPad: gst_pad_pullfunc_proxy, cothread_switch to peer
+
+There are a number of issues remaining with the scheduling, not the least
+of which is the fact that Connections are still dealt with the old way,
+with _push() functions and such.  I'm trying to figure out a way to unify
+the system so it makes sense.  Following the scheduling system is hard
+enough, trying to change it is murder.
+
+
+Another useful scheduling addition, mentioned above, is COTHREAD_STOPPING.  
+It's an element flag that's used to signal whatever code is running in
+cothread context that it should be finishing up and exiting soon.  An
+example of this is in plugins/cobin/spindentity.c.  All the loops should
+now be composed of do/while loops, rather than while(1) loops:
+
+  do {
+    buf = gst_pad_pull(spindentity->sinkpad);
+    gst_pad_push(spindentity->srcpad,buf);
+  } while (!GST_ELEMENT_IS_COTHREAD_STOPPING(element));
+
+The reason for this is that COTHREAD_STOPPING may be set before the above
+loop ever gets started.  It wouldn't do for the body of the loop to never
+once get called, that would simply stall the pipeline. Note that only the
+core library code is ever responsible for setting and unsetting this flag.  
+All elements have to do is respond to it by cleanly exiting the loop and
+the function holding it.
+
+This is needed primarily to allow iterations to occur properly.  
+Basically, there's a single entry point in the cothread scheduling loop,
+gst_bin_iterate_func() simply switches to this cothread.  If the element
+in this context is allowed to loop infinitely, nothing would even switch
+back to the context from which the iterate() was originally called.  This
+is a bit of a problem.  The solution is for there to be an implicit switch
+back to the originating context.  Now, even I'm not sure exactly how this
+works, but if the cothread that's switched to actually returns, execution
+returns back to the calling context, i.e. iterate_func().
+
+COTHREAD_STOPPING is therefore set just before switching into this
+(currently randomly chosen) context, on the assumption that it will return
+promptly after finishing its duties.  The burden of clearing the flag
+falls to the various wrapper functions provided by the Bin code, thus
+element writers don't have to worry about doing that at all (and simply
+shouldn't).
+
+
+Related changes:
+All the sources in elements/ have been changed to reflect the new system.
+
+
+FIXMEs:
+1) gstpipeline.c calls gst_src_push at some point, dunno why, it's
+commented out now.
+2) any other sources, including vcdsrc, dvdsrc, and v4lsrc will break
+badly and need to be modified to work as pull-based sources.

+STATUS: pull on srcpads is outdated, they use _get
+--------------------------------------------------
+
+0) definitions:
+
+All pads without further specifiers are assumed to belong to the element
+in question.  The pad's peer is always denoted with ->peer.  If there's
+question, pads will be prefixed with self-> and other-> as necessary.
+
+All elements in this document have at most one source and one sink pad,
+called srcpad and sinkpad. Multi-pad cases are supposed to be simple
+extrapolations except in a couple strange cases, to be covered elsewhere.
+
+
+1) loop functions:
+
+A loop function will call gst_pad_pull(sinkpad), do something, and call
+gst_pad_push(srcpad).
+
+gst_pad_pull first checks to see if there's a buffer in the pen.  If not,
+it calls that pad's pullfunc handler, passing it the peer pad.  When that
+finishes, we check again and return the buffer.  If no buffer, we squawk.
+The pullfunc handler simply causes a cothread switch to the peer pad's
+context;
+
+gst_pad_push places the buffer in the peer pad's pen, and calls the local
+pad's pushfunc.  The pushfunc simply causes a switch to the peer pad's
+context.
+
+
+2) chain functions
+
+The loopfunc constructed around a chain function starts by finding all
+sink pads.  For each sink pad, it calls gst_pad_pull.  This causes a
+switch to the peer pad's context and a buffer to appear, which is
+returned.  The pad is the handed off to the chain function, which
+presumably does some processing and calls gst_pad_push(), which causes a
+context switch to that pad's peer.
+
+
+
+3) source
+
+The loopfunc must repeatedly call the srcpad's pull

+OUTDATED
+--------
+
+
+A type properties system might look like following:
+
+
+1) Type definition includes the properties and their ranges:
+
+audio/mp3
+	layer:		1 - 3
+	bitrate:	8 - 320
+
+audio/raw
+	format:		bitfield (using asound.h definitions)
+	depth:		8 - 32
+	rate:		4000 - 96000
+	channels:	1 - n
+	interleave:	boolean
+
+video/raw
+	format:		32-bit FOURCC
+	bpp:		1 - 32
+	width:		1 - n
+	height:		1 - n
+	framerate:	32-bit float
+
+etc.
+
+
+2) An element can specify what subtypes it can deal with by creating a list of property tables:
+
+mpg123: audio/mp3
+	layer:		1 - 3
+	bitrate:	8 - 320
+
+osssink:
+	format:		S8, S16, etc.
+	depth:		8 - 16
+	rate:		8000 - 48000
+	channels:	1 - 2
+	interleave:	true
+
+And you could list several of these, so for instance if the card only supports 8-bit at up to 22KHz in
+mono, you can remove S8 from the above list and add a second entry:
+
+osssink:
+	format:		S8
+	depth:		8
+	rate:		8000 - 22050
+	channels:	1
+	interleave:	false (irrelevant)
+
+The obvious problem with these examples is that the rate isn't really 8000 - 48000, it's 8000, 11025,
+16000, 22050, 44100, and 48000.  However, we may be able to leave these to pad connect time.

+Phonon backend
+--------------
+
+ The phonon design is based around forming graphs using 3 basic components:
+
+ - a source component that generates raw audio/video/subtitle data, aka
+   MediaObject. 
+ - an effect component that applies effects to raw audio/video known as
+   AudioPath/VideoPath respectively. Subtitles are routed to a VideoPath
+ - output components that render audio or video called AudioOutput and
+   VideoOutput.
+
+  there is also a special input object that allows for feeding raw data in the
+  pipeline and specialized sinks to retrieve audio samples and video frames from
+  the pipeline.
+
+ A typical graph or a source that produces an audio and a video stream that
+ need to be played. The VideoPath and AudioPath typically contain no filters
+ in this case:
+
+                     +----+  +---
+                     | FX |  | ...
+                     +----+  +---
+                       V       V
+                      +-----------+      +-------------+
+                ----->| VideoPath |----->| VideoOutput |

+
+   - This is very similar to a regular gstreamer playback pipeline.
+
+  A typical graph of playing and crosfading two sources:
+
+                          +--------+
+                          | volume |
+                          +--------+
+                              V  
+     +-------------+    +-----------+                    
+     | MediaObject |--->| AudioPath |\                    
+     +-------------+    +-----------+ \     +-------------+
+                                       ---->| AudioOutput |
+     +-------------+    +-----------+ /     +-------------+
+     | MediaObject |--->| AudioPath |/                    
+     +-------------+    +-----------+                    
+                              ^  
+                          +--------+
+                          | volume |
+                          +--------+
+
+  - As soon as two audio paths are connected to one sink, the input signals are
+    mixed before sending them to the sink. The mixing is typically done in the
+    audio sink by an element such as adder.
+
+  Other types of graphs are possible too:
+
+                        +-----------+                    
+                       /| AudioPath |\                    
+     +-------------+  / +-----------+ \     +-------------+
+     | MediaObject |--                 ---->| AudioOutput |
+     +-------------+  \ +-----------+ /     +-------------+
+                       \| AudioPath |/
+                        +-----------+                    
+
+  - This graph sends the same out data to 2 effect filter graphs and then mixes
+    it to an audio output. The splitting of the graph typically happens with a
+    tee element after the media object.
+
+
+Questions
+---------
+
+ 1) do the following chains run
+ 
+    - synchronized with a shared clock?
+
+     +-------------+    +-----------+    +-------------+                
+     | MediaObject |--->| AudioPath |--->| AudioOutput |

+    - no API to set both MediaObjects atomically to play so it is assumed that
+      the playback starts and follows the rate of the global clock as soon as
+      the MediaObject is set to play. This makes unconnected chains run as if
+      they were in different GstPipelines.
+
+ 2) Threading:
+
+   - Can signals be emited from any thread?
+   - what operations are permited from a signal handler?
+
+ 3) Error reporting
+
+   - How does error reporting work?
+     * an audio/video device/port is busy.
+     * a fatal decoding error occured.
+     * a media type is not supported
+
+
+General
+-------
+
+ - Setting up KDE and Phonon build environment
+ - Testing, identifying test applications, building test cases
+ - Asking questions to Phonon maintainers/designers
+
+Essential classes
+-----------------
+
+These classes are essential to implement a backend and should be implemented
+first. 
+
+Phonon::BackendCapabilities
+
+  Mostly exposes features in the registry like available decoders and effects.
+
+Phonon::Factory
+
+  Entry point for the GStreamer backend. Provides methods to create instances of
+  object from our backed.
+
+
+Simple playback
+---------------
+
+The following classes need to be implemented in order to have simple playback
+capabilities from the backend.
+
+Phonon::AudioOutput
+
+  - Wrapper around audiosinks. Also needs provision for rate and format
+    conversions.  
+  - Mixing capabilities in the case when 2 audio paths are routed to it. 
+
+ Notes:
+
+  * is the volume related to the device or to the connection to the device.
+
+Phonon::VideoWidget
+
+  - Wrapper around videosinks. Also needs provision for colorspace and size
+    conversions.  Extends QWidget and probably needs to hook into the XOverlay
+    stuff to draw in the QT widget.  Supports fullscreen mode with a switch.
+
+  - Needs mixing capabilities in the case when 2 video paths are routed to it. 
+
+Phonon::AbstractMediaProducer
+
+  - contains stream selection
+  - play/pause/stop
+  - seeking
+  - periodically performs tick callbacks.
+
+Phonon::MediaObject:
+
+  - The object that decodes the media into raw audio/video/subtitle.
+    This object will use the GStreamer decodebin element to perform the
+    typefinding and decoding.
+
+Phonon::AudioPath/Phonon::VideoPath
+
+  - Simple container for audio/video effect plugins. 
+  - Handles adding/removing of effects, making sure that the streaming is not
+    interrupted and the formats are all compatible.
+
+
+Effect support
+--------------
+
+Phonon::Visualization
+
+  Connects an AudioPath to a VideoWidget and allows for selection of a
+  visualisation plugin.
+
+Phonon::AudioEffect/Phonon::VideoEffect
+
+  Base classes
+
+Phonon::VolumeFaderEffect
+
+  Alows fade-in and fade-out with a configurable curve and time. Needs
+  GstController.
+
+Phonon::BrightnessControl
+
+  Controls the brightness of video.
+
+
+Playlist support
+----------------
+
+Phonon::MediaQueue:
+
+  ?? don't know yet where this fits in.
+
+
+Capture
+-------
+
+Phonon::AvCapture
+
+  Synchronized audio and video capture. 
+
+Phonon::AudioWriter
+
+  Compress audio.
+
+
+Advanced features
+-----------------
+ 
+Phonon::ByteStream
+
+  Feed raw data into the pipeline. Used for streaming network access.
+
+ Implementation:
+
+  Possibly a specialized source element connected to a decodebin.
+
+ Notes:
+
+  * Phonon::ByteStream::writeData
+   - can it block?
+
+  * Phonon::ByteStream::setStreamSeekable
+   - If called before starting the ByteStream, decodebin might operate in pull
+     based mode when supported. Else the source is activated in push mode.
+   - If called after starting ByteStream, the Phonon::ByteStream::seekStream
+     signal can be called for push-based seekable streams.
+
+  * Can the signals be emited from a streaming thread?
+   
+
+Phonon::AudioDataOutput/Phonon::VideoDataOutput/
+
+  Receive raw audio/video data from the pipeline. Used to allow applications to
+  deal with the raw data themselves.
+
+ Implementation:
+
+  Possibly a specialized sink element.
+
+ Notes :
+
+  * Phonon::AudioDataOutput::dataReady
+    - can this be emited from the streaming threads?
+
+  * Phonon::AudioDataOutput::endOfMedia 
+    - can this be emited from the streaming threads?
+    - We need to grab this EOS message synchronously from the bus.
+    - should be emited _before_ sending the last dataReady. This means we need
+      to cache at least one dataReady.
+
+  * Phonon::AudioDataOutput::setDataSize
+    - can this be a _suggested_ data size or does every callback need to be of
+      this size?
+

+SOMEWHAT OUTDATED
+-----------------
+
+
+We describe how the plugin system works.
+
+Plugins
+-------
+
+plugins are basically shared libraries with a plugin_init
+function.
+
+they provide the GStreamer core library with the following
+information:
+
+  - element factories
+  - type factories
+  - metadata factories?
+
+ElementFactory
+--------------
+
+element factories provide the core library with elements (duh)
+
+an element factory has the following information:
+
+  - a unique name for the element factory
+  - strings describing the element (name, desciption, copyright,...)
+  - a description of the media types it accepts (as capabilities) 
+  - a description of the media types it outputs (as capabilities)
+
+
+TypeFactory
+-----------
+
+has the following properties:
+
+ - a mime type
+ - file extensions that may provide a hint for this type
+ - a function to detect this type
+ - a string to detect this type (file(1) like)
+
+
+XML registry
+------------
+
+The complete plugin tree will be exported into an XML description so
+that the definitions of the factories can be obtained without having
+to load and plugin_init the plugins.
+
+Loading of plugins
+------------------
+
+at some point, the plugin will need to be read into memory before
+any elements it provides can be used. the XML description of the
+loaded plugin will need to be updated.
+
+We will have the following methods for (implicitly) loading plugins:
+
+ gst_plugin_load_all()
+
+  remove the complete XML tree and read all the plugins in the
+  paths. The plugin_init method will be called and the XML tree
+  will be rebuild in memory.
+
+ gst_plugin_load (name)
+
+  The plugin will be located in the tree and if it allready loaded, the
+  function returns. If it is not loaded, the XML entry is removed and
+  the plugin is loaded. The plugin_init is called so that the XML tree
+  is reconstructed.
+
+ gst_elementfactory_create (factory, name);
+
+  The plugin providing the element will be located, if the plugin is
+  allready loaded, an element with the given name is created.
+  if the plugin is not loaded, gst_plugin_load is called.
+  the loaded factory is located again and the element is created.
+
+ The typefind function is called
+
+  When the plugin description  is read from the XML file, the typefind 
+  function is hooked up to a dummy typefind function. The dummy typefind 
+  function will locate the plugin it belongs to and call gst_plugin_load.
+  after the loading of the plugin, the real typefind function is called.

+GStreamer Release Policies (or: why we should become a country and pass laws)
+--------------------------
+
+Development Period
+------------------
+Development period is marked by having a fourth (nano) version number of 1.
+During development anything goes short of wiping the tree.
+Just try doing a few basic things :
+- make sure it builds for you !
+- check what you're about to commit with cvs -Q diff -r
+- preferably, keep an anonymous checkout around as well so you can
+  immediately update and check if your changes work in a clean tree as well
+
+Prerelease Period
+-----------------
+After a bit of development, people want a new release.  This generally happens
+when :
+- core developers get anxious to apply massive changes to the core bound
+  to break everything
+- a few important plugins decide, as if by magic, to work again (avi, mad, ...)
+- thaytan or thomasvs get tired of being lazy.
+
+Also, this should only be allowed after passing a few sanity checks :
+- make distcheck should pass
+- rpms should build
+- FIXME: should debs be built here ? If so, how ?
+
+At this time, we need to do a few prereleases for general checking by all
+interested developers.  To minimize the impact on the rest of the core hacking,
+we create a new CVS branch which will go through the pre-releases and finally
+contain the definitive tarball for that version.
+
+RELEASE PROCEDURE:
+-----------------
+
+- www/bin/new-release is a release helper script.  It automates a lot of the
+  tedious work.  Now releasing looks like this:
+
+- before release:
+  - make sure all blocker bugs for that release are fixed or deferred
+  - make sure you have a local copy of all online files
+  - run 'make download-po' to make sure translations in CVS are up-to-date,
+    and then 'make update-po' in po/ (which will update the .pot template too
+    and merge the changes into the .po files)
+  - Make one or more prereleases
+    - Make sure you've got the latest clean CVS of the module
+    - Run bin/data-get in www/ to sync data from website
+    - Bump the nano number to > 2 (eg, first pre-release for 
+      0.10.12 is 0.10.11.2)
+    - When releasing -base/-good/-ugly/-bad/gnonlin, make sure GST_REQ and
+      GST_PBREQ are up-to-date. In particular, keep GST_REQ of the
+      to-be-released -base module in sync with the core version that is to
+      be released at the same time
+    - Re-autogen if not in maintainer-mode (which you should be)
+    - Check (and fix if necessary) make distcheck
+    - run 'make release' to build the tarballs
+    - copy tarballs+md5 sums to the data/src/$module/pre/ dir
+    - Run bin/data-put in www/ to sync the new tarballs to the website
+    - Announce the availability of the new tarballs
+    - Tell the translation project by sending an email to 
+      coordinator@translationproject.org, eg:
+        Subject: gst-plugins-bad-0.10.5.2.pot available
+        Tarball is at http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-plugins-bad/pre/gst-plugins-bad-0.10.5.2.tar.bz2 
+
+- prepare the release:
+  - Make sure your www is up to date: Run bin/data-get in www/
+  - Update the doap file to insert the new release info
+  - bin/new-release (module) (version) (checkoutdir) (release name)
+    - updates cvs
+    - allows you to update versioning in configure.ac
+    - rebuilds
+    - updates ChangeLog
+    - adds a new releases/module/version.xml file and lets you edit
+      --> here you add/fix up the features (from ChangeLog) and check
+	  contributors
+    - allows you to update NEWS file with snippets from RELEASE
+      --> copy stuff
+    - rebuilds docs for plugins
+    - rolls release tarballs and puts them in the local www/data tree
+    - uploads docs to website
+    - commits changes to po files
+    - shows you a diff for evaluation
+
+  - build packages to test
+
+- release:
+  - cvs commit in the tree
+  - tag tree
+    for example for 0.6.3 :
+           cvs tag RELEASE-0_6_3
+  - bump nano number in configure.ac, commit
+  - if working in the "stable" release branch, update to this tag to freeze it:
+    cvs up -r RELEASE-0_6_3
+  - sync source and packages to website
+    + run /bin/data-put in www
+  - change versions in www/src/htdocs/entities.gst
+  - add entry on website
+    + Edit src/htdocs/news/news.xml and add a new item at the bottom.
+  - commit additions to website
+  - add versions and milestones in bugzilla
+  - upload new core, -base and -good tarballs to gnome ftp
+    + e.g:
+       scp gstreamer-0.10.42.tar.gz master.gnome.org:
+       ssh master.gnome.org
+       install-module gstreamer-0.10.42.tar.gz
+
+  - Send release announcements to:
+    gstreamer-devel@lists.sourceforge.net gstreamer-announce@lists.sourceforge.net kde-multimedia@kde.org gnome-multimedia@gnome.org
+  - Update freshmeat with new releases (get Uraeus to do it)
+
+Old release notes - superseded by the www/bin/new-release script.
+----------------------------------------------------------------
+
+TODO :
+  - Decide on the next version number (major, minor or micro upgrade ?)
+  - Get a fresh copy to do the necessary tests on
+  - If this isn't on the stable branch (like for 0.6), then create a new branch;
+    - with 0.3.3 as an example, tag is BRANCH-RELEASE-0_3_3
+      cvs tag BRANCH-RELEASE-0_3_3-ROOT
+      cvs tag -b BRANCH-RELEASE-0_3_3
+    - update your local copy to the branch:
+      cvs update -r BRANCH-RELEASE-0_3_3
+  - Set the nano to 2 (in configure.ac, AS_VERSION)
+  - If this is a release candidate for a new major version, override
+    MAJOR/MINOR in configure.ac
+  - Do all updates/patches/changes for the release tarball in this branch
+  - Think of a good codename for the release
+  - Check the bug lists:
+    - The idea is to have all bugs for this milestone listed as fixed
+    - Check all of the bug reports with this version as a milestone, and verify
+      that these bugs are fixed, or reassign to a later milestone if not
+    - Check later milestone bugs, and if any of them are fixed, reassign to
+      this milestone
+    - Check the list of bugs resolved with milestone HEAD, which should be
+      assigned to an actual milestone
+  - create a new $(version).xml file in www/src/htdocs/releases/$(module)
+    and add that to cvs
+  - Start updating the release notes on the www cvs tree
+    - create the base xml file in www/htdocs/releases/$/module)/$(version).xml
+    - grepping ChangeLog for contributors:
+ grep "<.*>" ChangeLog | perl -i -p -e 's@\d*-\d*-\d*\s*(.*)\s*<.*$@$1@' | sort | uniq
+    - use www/bin/bugzilla (module) (version) to get an xml list of the
+      bugs fixed in this version, and add it to the release .xml
+  - depending on how the API has changed update the libtool versioning
+    in configure.ac, AS_LIBTOOL 
+    (Look at the libtool info page about versioning for guidelines)
+    (if MAJOR/MINOR version has changed, however, you can reset all to 0)
+  - FIXME: autotools have latest config.{guess,sub}
+           This is needed in order to support newer platforms.
+           On Debian install the autotools-dev package to get these.
+           Someone please add some more useful info here on how to do this
+  - while (IS_PRERELEASE)
+    {
+      - increase the nano number (starting with 2)
+      - check out a fresh anonymous copy
+        cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gstreamer.sf.net:/cvsroot/gstreamer \
+            co -rBRANCH-RELEASE-0_3_3 gstreamer
+      - make distcheck, rpm build should pass, from a FRESH cvs tree
+      - media tests should be done
+      - source tarball should be installed and tested
+      - rpms should be installed and tested
+      - .2 tarball should be submitted to translation project
+      - put up tarball for a day
+    }
+
+
+Release Period
+--------------
+When we're satisfied with the prereleases, it's time to make the final tarball.
+It's very important that the tarball we put out is fully checked, works as
+planned, and generally is generated only ONCE by someone with a relatively
+clean (and reference) system.  We don't want to put out more than one tarball
+with the same name.
+
+TODO :
+  - give the latest prerelease another good testing
+  - proofread the release notes
+  - run bugzilla with the correct module and milestone and include
+    the output in the release notes
+    bin/bugzilla gstreamer 0.7.5 >> src/htdocs/releases/gstreamer/0.7.5.xml
+    then edit it
+  - verify all new translations are in and po files are updated:
+    run 'make download-po' to make sure translations in CVS are up-to-date,
+    and then 'make update' in po/ (which will update the .pot template too and
+    merge the changes into the .po files)
+  - run win32-update from toplevel to copy new versions and enum files
+  - copy  www/htdocs/releases/$(module)/$(version) to RELEASE
+  - copy the list of changes, bugs fixed, and API changes and add them to NEWS
+  - update the ChangeLog to account for NEWS, RELEASE, and configure.ac,
+    mentioning the release name
+  -  add === release (version) === to ChangeLog
+  - update web site docs
+    - release-specific docs should go in CVS
+    - change docs/current symlink
+  - remove the nano version number in configure.ac, AS_VERSION
+  - cvs commit
+  - tag tree
+    for example for 0.6.3 :
+           cvs tag RELEASE-0_6_3
+  - run "make release", build rpms
+  - install on gnome's ftp
+  - for plugins docs: run "make update" in docs/plugins to update version info
+  - for docs: run "make upload" from gstreamer/docs to get the new docs online
+  - change www/src/htdocs/entities.gst with the new version numbers
+  - change www/src/htdocs/bugs/bugs.xml and add a new milestone
+  - possibly add new version and milestone to bugzilla
+  - add a news item to the news.xml
+
+Post-Release Period
+-------------------
+Time to bring the new version under the eyes of the public.
+
+TODO :
+  - FIXME: should we md5 the tarballs?
+  - upload to sourceforge
+      upload.sourceforge.net/incoming
+      administer the release
+
+  - FIXME: announcements
+    - gstreamer-{devel, announce} : a simple mail with RELEASE
+    - freshmeat
+    - linux-audio-dev (if it's a big release) : a simple mail with RELEASE
+    - gnome lists (?)
+    - lwn (if it's a big release)
+  - send mail for translators with URL to .tar.bz2:
+    translation@iro.umontreal.ca 
+  - Kick back, have a party, enjoy people coming in on IRC telling us how
+    GStreamer rocks.
+  - Later on, if necessary, merge back latest release branch to current dev
+    branch (if patches to source were made)
+
+    TWO WAYS:
+    A)
+       * get a diff between the branch root and the final release:
+         cvs diff -r BRANCH-RELEASE-0_7_5-ROOT -r RELEASE-0_7_5 > patch
+       * fix up this patch (remove RELEASE)
+       * and apply it to the HEAD branch
+       * update nano version to 1 in configure.ac
+                                                                                
+    B)
+       * change to a HEAD branch, make sure it's updated
+       * cvs diff -R -r RELEASE-0_3_4-30SECONDFRENCHMAN
+         gives a list of differences between head and release tag,
+         stuff with > is how it's in HEAD, < is in the rel branch
+
+       * cvs update -j BRANCH-RELEASE-0_3_4
+         merges the difference made in that branch to the current source
+         this is what you want to use when merging back the branch
+         resolve conflicts and commit
+
+Some various random comments that might or might not make sense :
+
+- Should work:
+  * autoconf feature to allow building outside source dir
+
+- Package version policy
+  - Use major.minor.micro versioning
+  - Before 1.0.0, Update micro until code and API are fairly stable,
+    then update minor.
+  - After 1.0.0,
+    Update major when code and api hit new level of stability or major features.
+    Update minor on API changes.
+    Update micro on API-compatible changes.
+
+NOTES ON STARTING A NEW STABLE SERIES
+-------------------------------------
+- Given x.y.z being the last devel release, where y is an odd number
+- all API/ABI/renaming changes should be done
+- for every module:
+  - get a completely fresh checkout
+  - set GST_MAJORMINOR to x.(y + 1)
+  - reset libtool versioning to 0, 0, 0
+  - build every piece
+  - grep for possible non-updates of MAJORMINOR:
+    grep -r "0\.9" * | grep -v "0\.9\.6" | less -R
+    change stuff:
+    perl -i -p -e 's@0\.9(\.[^0-9])@0.10$1@g' (file) changes 0.9. -> 0.10.
+    perl -i -p -e 's@0\.9([^.])@0.10$1@g' (file) changes 0.9 -> 0.10

+RTP client subsystem proposal.
+Ramon Garcia Fernandez
+
+A brief description of the RTP protocol.
+
+The RTP protocol uses two connections: one for passing data and another for control. The control connection is used for starting, finishing, and passing statistics of lost packets. On the data connection, packets are transmitted containing the media. These packets have a 7 bit field that says what codec is the data transmitted with. This codec is variable. However data cannot change from audio to video in packets of the same connection. All the packets belong to the same logical stream, that is, for instanace, to the same speech, or to the same song. Different codecs in the same stream is used, for instance, to insert comfort noise.
+
+Each codec is packeted in a specific way in RTP packets. This is necessary to minimize the damage produced by lost packets. Therefore, packets should be arranged so that each packet can be decoded independently. If a packet is lost, that shoudn't preclude the decoding of following packets.
+
+
+Suggested implementation:
+
+Tbe implementation that I suggest contains an rtpdec element. This element has one sink pad for the data, one src pad for the decoded data, and a pair of src and sink pads for control messages. The decoded data that comes from rtpdec has no RTP dependency. It is in the format expected by the codec that it decodes it. Therefore, rtpdec must do codec specific processing of data to take into account that different codecs are stored differently in RTP.
+
+A posible pipeline is:
+
+udpcon name="data" udpcon name="control" data.src!rtpdec.datasrc  control.src!rtpdec.controlin control.sink!rtpdec.controlout rtpdec name="rtpdec" ! mp3decode ! osssink
+
+udpcon is an element (not yet written) that provides a src and a sink pad to read and write to a socket. There are two udpcon, one for reading the data socket and another for reading and writting to the control socket.
+
+To handle variable types, the following would work (the UDP part left out for clarity is identical to the one above):
+
+[udp] rtpdec ! spider ! osssink
+
+rtpdec has a property that tells it the mapping of the payload bits to mime type. This is necessary, because that mapping is not fixed. It has to be obtained at runtime through other mechanisms, such as a SDP file obtained by http or rtsp.
+
+A posible implementation of rtpdec is a bin that contains two elements: a media independent _rtpparse and a media dependent rtp-dec-mp3. Thus the pipeline would be
+
+udpsrc ! _rtpparse ! rtp-dec-mp3 ! mp3decode ! osssink
+       \________________________/
+             rtpdec bin
+
+Another posible implementation is, that rtpdec opens a plugin that contains the code to convert the codec specific packets into the input that the normal decoder for that codec expects.
+
+Ronald said that this mechanism would be complicated because it would require to duplicate the functionality of the plugin loader. It shouldn't be like that because it should use the normal plugin loader. However, this is an issue that I do not fully understand.
+
+Ronald suggested to use inheritance. Thus the user should insert a codec specific rtp element in the pipeline. Such as:
+
+udpsrc ! rtp-mp3 ! mp3decode ! osssink
+
+Reuse of RTP logic would be achived through inhertiance. 
+
+This looks more logical, because inheritance reflects the fact that rtp-mp3 "is an" specialization of rtp. However, there are several issues. As stated above, it is posible in RTP to switch the encoding of the media at any time. If this happens, some state must be kept, such as statistics of packets received and sent.

+Random notes on signals:

+* Use a BOXED (and not a POINTER) marshaller when your signal will have a 
+  GstBuffer argument:
+
+g_signal_new ("handoff", G_TYPE_FROM_CLASS (klass), G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST,
+              G_STRUCT_OFFSET (GstIdentityClass, handoff), NULL, NULL,

+              GST_TYPE_BUFFER | G_SIGNAL_TYPE_STATIC_SCOPE);
+
+* For GstBuffers arguments, consider using G_SIGNAL_TYPE_STATIC_SCOPE as it
+  can prevent an extra copy of the buffer

+GstController:
+==============
+
+Implementation:
+---------------
+
+Ideas and plans:
+  - Deprecate control-rate property and add a control-period property
+    that does the same and is named appropiately. Damn confusing names.
+
+  - gst_object_suggest_next_sync() will not be used at all anymore.
+    Note this in the docs and explain correct usage in elements.
+
+  - Optimize get_value_array() functions to not just call get() but be
+    a bit more intelligent.
+  - Optimize trigger interpolator's get_value_array() to set trigger if
+    a requested value's timestamp is before the trigger timestamp and
+    this timestamp + sample period is after the trigger timestamp.
+
+  - Get tempo interface in base (or core?) and have it modify the
+    control rate to get expected results.
+
+  - ? Let get_value_array() sample the values with control-period if
+    the given sample_interval is zero ?
+
+
+Usage in elements:
+------------------
+
+  - In the beginning of the processing loop call
+    gst_object_sync_values() with the current timestamp.
+  - Convert the controller's control-period property into frames/samples
+    and request values sampled with control-period to apply one value to
+    each control-period frames/samples.
+  - Update controlled GObject properties with the last values, i.e.
+    call gst_object_sync_values() with the end timestamp.
+
+  - ! The user has to choose a good control-period to prevent two trigger
+    timestamps separated by less than control-period nanoseconds.
+
+  code:
+
+  FIXME: can this be simplified? bugs in corner cases?
+  
+  [...]
+  GstController ctrl = gst_object_get_controller (self);
+  GstValueArray prop1;
+  prop1.property_name = "prop1";
+  if (ctrl) {
+    gst_controller_sync_values (ctrl, GST_BUFFER_TIMESTAMP);
+    samples_per_period = control-period / sample-rate;
+    nvalues = num_samples / samples_per_period;
+    prop1.nbsamples = nvalues;
+    prop1.sample_interval = control-period;
+    prop1.values = g_new (type, nvalues);
+    gst_controller_get_value_array (ctrl, GST_BUFFER_TIMESTAMP, &prop1);
+  } else {
+    prop1.values = &self->prop1;
+    samples_per_period = num_samples;
+  }
+  [...]
+
+  for (i = 0; i < num_samples; i++) {
+    prop1_val = prop1.values[i / samples_per_period];
+    process();
+  }
+
+  [...]
+  if (ctrl) {
+    gst_controller_sync_values (ctrl, GST_BUFFER_TIMESTAMP + GST_BUFFER_DURATION);

+There are a number of different ways of coding a GstSrc.  I'll try to
+outline them and how the function here: 
+
+1a) Simple push-function based with single output
+
+
+ *------*      *------
+ !      !      !
+ ! src  !--->--! plugin
+ !      !      !      
+ *------*      *------
+
+This is the style that all the existing sources use.  There is a single
+output pad, and a _push function that's global to the whole element.  The
+_push function simply constructs buffers and pushes them out the pad. 
+
+Chained (current implementation): 
+
+
+      bin               src               pad1           pad2            plugin
+       !                                              (= pad1->peer)
+ gst_bin_iterate

+
+Typically this will be the/an entry into the Bin.  The Bin's iterate
+function simply calls the Src's _push function.  When the _push function
+pushes a buffer out it's pad, the chain function of the peer pad is
+called, presumably causing a push out the other side of that element, and
+eventually data gets to the other end.  The stack unrolls, and the
+iteration ends for that Src. 
+
+
+
+Cothreaded: 
+
+Again, the source would generally be an entry into the Bin.  A loopfunc
+will be constructed around it, which will simply loop calling the Src's
+_push function as in the non-cothreaded case.  When the _push function
+pushes a buffer, it finds a pushfunc attached to the pad, drops the buffer
+in the pen, and calls the pushfunc provided by the Bin.  This causes a
+switch to the next element, then the next, to the end, at which point a
+buffer pull will travel back down the chain.  The _push function gets
+context and finishes, at which point the loopfunc wrapper simply calls it
+again in the next iteration.

+Also similar to the single output variant.  When the pull winds its way

+A lot of data streams need a few initial buffers to make sense of the
+data stream.  With these initial buffers, it can pick up at any point in
+the rest of the data stream.
+
+Exampes:
+- Vorbis and Theora have three initial Ogg packets
+- MPEG4 has codec data
+- GDP protocol serializes the initial new_segment event and the initial caps
+
+It is important that elements that get connected after the stream starts,
+receive these initial buffers.  Also, sink elements should know that these
+initial buffers are necessary for every new "client" of the sink element;
+for example, multifdsink needs to send these initial buffers before the
+normal buffers.
+
+Currently, this is done by putting a 'streamheader' value on the caps.
+'streamheader' is a GST_TYPE_ARRAY of GstBuffer, ie. an ordered list of
+buffers.
+
+The buffers themselves still get pushed as normal buffers, but with the
+IN_CAPS flag set.  This allows elements that do not know about streamheader
+to still function correctly (ie. filesink and others)
+
+It is of course important that these streamheader buffers are not sent twice
+(once because they're in the caps, and once because they're received as
+buffers).
+
+So, an element that is aware of streamheader in the caps should probably best
+drop all incoming IN_CAPS buffers.
+
+Rules for sending streamheaders:
+- all streamheader buffers should have IN_CAPS set
+- from this list of streamheader buffers, a "streamheader" caps field should
+  be created as a GST_TYPE_ARRAY of GstBuffer.  This should be done by
+  copying the buffers.
+  (the only important thing about the buffers in this list is the data;
+   other attributes of the buffers get ignored)
+- each of these buffers should then have these caps set on them.
+- when all streamheader buffers are collected in the element, pad caps should
+  be set, including this streamheader
+- streamheader buffers should be sent consecutively, and before any of the
+  data (non-IN_CAPS) buffers they apply to.  If necessary, the element
+  should internally queue non-IN_CAPS buffers until the streamheaders
+  are completely assembled.
+- when new streamheader buffers need to be pushed out, this process is
+  repeated.  Receiving a new IN_CAPS buffer after a non-IN_CAPS buffer
+  signifies resetting streamheader, as does the new set_caps with different
+  streamheader right before. (FIXME: it's probably better to explicitly
+  have an event/buffer that clears streamheaders; consider the case of
+  an element like GDP that has created streamheader from the first newsegment
+  and the first caps, and then receives a new tag event that it also wants
+  to put on the streamheader - it should be able to invalidate the previous
+  ones)
+
+Elements that can send streamheader caps:
+- vorbisenc
+- theoraenc
+- gdppay
+
+Elements that can receive streamheader caps:
+- multifdsink
+
+Elements that can receive and send streamheader caps:
+- oggmux
+
+Elements that could/should use this:
+- ffenc_mpeg4 (currently uses/sets codec_data)
+- theoradec, vorbisdec (currently only look at incoming buffers)
+- oggdemux
+
+FUTURE PLANS
+------------
+The concept of streamheader is more generally applicable.  We may want to
+find a better way of implementing this than having two ways of telling
+downstream elements about them.  Currently an element that is
+streamheader-aware needs to look both at caps and incoming buffers.
+
+One option would be to only rely on the buffer flow, and make all elements
+aware of a HEADER flag, causing them to keep these buffers around and push
+them for each new pad link.  This needs to be done in every element; a
+scenario like
+  videotestsrc ! theoraenc
+where later on an oggmux gets connected, should still work without dropping
+these header buffers.  But similarly,
+  videotestsrc ! theoraenc ! identity
+with a later connection of oggmux to identity should work.
+
+This could tie in with an idea to have pads store some initial data (the
+first new_segment event, tag events, ...), which at the moment also get
+dropped on dynamic in-stream links.

+# OpenGL usage
+How to set up openGL using plugins in such a way that they can
+render to an on-screen window, or offscreen equally?
+
+eg:
+superfoo3d ! glwindow
+or
+superfoo3d ! gloffscreen ! xvideowindow
+
+This would imply that there is some mime type which connects a glwindow/gloffscreen and a GL using component sensibly. I don't see that there is any actual 
+data to send, however - the only purpose of the glwindow/gloffscreen is to 
+set up an openGL context and then 'output' it somehow one the superfoo3d has
+finished drawing each frame.
+
+In the case of glwindow, 'output' it means translate into an on-screen window,
+but for gloffscreen it means produce a video packet and go.
+
+These components really need some other 2 way communication, rather than the
+pads metaphor, I think?

+# Compositing and video overlays.
+We want a way to composite a video frame and an overlay frame. The video frame is as we expect, the overlay is a normal video frame + an alpha mask. In the following monologue, please consider that I mean RGB/I420/YV12/YUY2 wherever I say RGB.
+
+So we have a plugin with 2 sinks and one src:
+   +----------------+
+   |video           |
+   |           video|
+   |overlay         |
+   +----------------+
+
+What should the format for the overlay data look like?
+Ideas:
+ * RGBA   - 4 byte per pixel video frame
+ * RGB+A  - 3 Bytes per pixel video frame, then 1 byte per pixel overlay frame.
+            A new mime type, or a variation on video/raw? I'm not sure
+ * Overlay is actually 2 sinks, one takes a RGB/YUV data the other the alpha channel.
+
+I'm not sure which approach is better, but I think it is probably neatest to 
+use RGB+A, and then have a separate plugin which has 2 sinks and converts an
+RGB/YUV stream plus an alpha stream into an RGB+A stream. The benefit of RGB+A over RGBA in this scenario, is that it is easier (correct me if I'm wrong) to optimise 2 block copies which appends an alpha frame to a RGB frame than it is to
+do the many copies required to interleave them into an RGBA stream.
+
+So, I see this producing a few new plugins:
+videooverlay - takes an RGB and an RGB+A frame from 2 sinks, does the overlay (according to some properties) and outputs a result frame in RGB or RGB+A (as negotiated) format on 1 src.
+rgb2rgba - takes 1 RGB frame and one A frame from 2 sinks and outputs RGB+A on 1 src. If the A sink is not connected, we just add a fixed alpha channel based on an object-property.
+rgb2rgba - takes an RGB+A frame and discards the RGB component.
+textoverlay - This plugin, instead of taking a video frame and overlaying text, can just output an RGB+A stream with appropriate timestamping. This prevents duplicating code to composite with an alpha mask and allows us to optimise it in one spot only.

+Set of 0.4.0 proposals
+
+* module versioning
+  - we need an agreement on how we are going to version the separate modules.
+    This needs to meet some requirements :
+    a) we shouldn't be forced to release all of the modules together 
+       every time (if the plugins have been updated, and still work against
+       a previous core, then only release plugins, for example)
+       We should start treating the different modules as separate projects
+       (albeit still closely tied of course)
+    b) it should be clear for other people what packages they need to download
+    c) major API breakage needs to be clear; we don't expect really old players
+       to keep working with really new cores.
+
+   - my idea (which others seemed to agree with) would be to let the micro
+     numbers run independently.  Only when the core API has changed to the
+     point that other modules are not compatible with them anymore
+     should we upgrade the minor version.
+     We can assume/assert that modules with the same minor number will be able
+     to work with each other.
+     
+    - Example schedule : 
+      * we release 0.4.0 versions of all of the modules
+      * plugins get updated a few times : 0.4.1 and 0.4.2
+      * core gets a new scheduler, doesn't affect other modules : 0.4.1
+      * gst-player gets rapid releases due to arik's recovery: 0.4.1-0.4.5
+      * core gets a major new update re: events : 0.5.0
+      * some days later, other modules have been updated to the new core
+        and the new core starts being useful to other people as well
+	
+* release practice
+  - we should have a simple way to cut releases; something that makes
+    the necessary adaptions to the source tree
+    This could also be a simple check list of things that need to pass
+  - cvs tarballs/packages should be easily distinguishable from pre-release
+    tarballs/packages and actual released ones.
+
+    my idea here would be :
+    a) releases are named as normal
+       e.g. gstreamer-0.4.0.tar.gz
+            gstreamer-0.4.0-1.i386.rpm
+
+    b) as soon as the release is made, we are back in "cvs" mode
+       i'd use a ".1" for a fourth version number for all cvs versions
+         so as soon as we release 0.4.0, I'd add a fourth ".1" version number.
+	 this one would be used during the whole of the cvs period, no
+	 reason to up this manually in between
+	The packages (rpms in any case, don't know about debs) would still
+	keep the date as the revision number like they have now, in order
+	to make it easy to work with snapshots.
+
+    c) when we are ready to release this module, I would go back to maintainer
+       mode, but keep the fourth version number and increase that for each cut.
+       So we'd stop developing the module, switch to maintainer mode, up the
+       version number to
+       gstreamer-0.4.0.2.tar.gz
+       and test that.
+
+     d) when we are happy with the precuts, we drop the fourth number and make
+        a release
+
+     Summary :
+     * all "official" released versions have sane versioning with three numbers
+     * all "cvs" versions are clearly recognizable by the fourth .1
+     * all "precuts" are also recognizable
+     * no tarballs will accidentally spill pretending to be real releases ;)
+     * upgrading rpm's all through this process is easy
+	 
+* build code stuff duplicated between various modules
+  - how do we integrate these ? this pertains to stuff in autogen.sh,
+    duplicate stuff in configure.ac (which should probably be moved out to
+    custom .m4 files and yanked in), and maybe testing stuff
+  
+* what possible ways are there to build gstreamer ?
+  I would like to take stock of the combinations of deps possible to build
+  gstreamer.  While most people want only glib2, I think there is merit
+  in still making glib1 work and willing to put in the effort.  I just need
+  the possibilities mapped out once and for all ;) IMO the effort going into
+  making gstreamer build without libxml is the same as making it work with
+  older glib too.  I mean, as soon as you allow variation, it isn't that hard
+  to allow for more than one variation.  The bigger step is from zero to one.
+  
+  so, what are they ?
+  - glib1 & gtk1
+  - glib1 & gtk1 & libxml
+  - glib2 & libxml2
+  
+* media suite
+  - media files on the site should be renamed to simple uniform names
+  - and split up based on size
+  - described by features/content
+
+* when to branch in CVS ?
+
+* automatic build testing
+  - tinderbox ? useful ?
+  - small build scripts
+  
+* automatic functionality testing
+  - an md5sink would be useful to do this
+  - something automated is needed; it should check if you have the plugins
+    that are needed to test other plugins
+
+* media player
+
+* packaging
+  - dependency libs should be easily available

+ELEMENTS (v4lsrc, alsasrc, osssrc)
+--------
+- capturing elements should not do fps/sample rate correction themselves
+  they should timestamp buffers according to "a clock", period.
+
+- if the element is the clock provider:
+  - timestamp buffers based on the internals of the clock it's providing,
+    without calling the exposed clock functions
+  - do this by getting a measure of elapsed time based on the internal clock
+    that is being wrapped.  Ie., count the number of samples the *device*
+    has processed/dropped/...
+    If there are no underruns, the produced buffers are a contiguous data
+    stream.  
+  - possibilities:
+    - the device has a method to query for the absolute time related to
+      a buffer you're about to capture or just have captured:
+      Use that time as the timestamp on the capture buffer
+      (it's important that this time is related to the capture buffer;
+       ie. it's a time that "stands still" if you're not capturing)
+    - since you're providing the clocking, but don't have the previous method,
+      you should open the device with a given rate and continuously read
+      samples from it, even in PAUSED.  This allows you to update an internal
+      clock.
+      You use this internal clock as well to timestamp the buffers going out,
+      so you again form a contiguous set of buffers.
+      The only acceptable way to continuously read samples then is in a private
+      thread.
+  - as long as no underruns happen, the flow being output is a perfect stream:
+    the flow is data-contiguous and time-contiguous.
+  - underruns should be handled like this:
+    - if the code can detect how many samples it dropped, it should just
+      send the next buffer with the new correct offset.  Ie, it produced
+      a data gap, and since it provides the clock, it produces a perfect
+      data gap (the timestamp will be correctly updated too).
+    - if it cannot detect how many samples it dropped, there's a fallback
+      algorithm.  The element uses another GstClock (for example, system clock)
+      on which it corrects the skew and drift continuously as long as it
+      doesn't drop.  When it detected a drop, it can get the time delta
+      on the other GstClock since the last time it captured and the current
+      time, and use that delta to guesstimate the number of samples dropped.
+
+- if the element is not the clock provider
+  - the element should always respect the clock it is given.
+  - the element should timestamp outgoing buffers based on time given by
+    the provided clock, by querying for the time on that clock, and
+    comparing to the base time.
+  - the element should NOT drop/add frames.  Rather, it should just
+    - timestamp the buffers with the current time according to the provided
+      clock
+    - set the duration according to the *theoretical/nominal* framerate
+    - when underruns happen (the device has lost capture data because our
+      element is not handling them quickly enough), this should be detectable
+      by the element through the device.  On underrun, the offset of your
+      next buffer will not match the end_offset of your previous one
+      (ie, the data flow is no longer contiguous).
+      If the exact number of samples dropped is detectable, this is the
+      difference between new offset and old offset_end.
+      If it's not detectable, it should be guessed based on the elapsed time
+      between now and the last capture.
+
+- a second element can be responsible for making the stream time-contiguous.
+  (ie, T1 + D1 = T2 for all buffers).  This way they are made
+  acceptible for gapless presentation (which is useful for audio).
+  - The element treats the incoming stream as data-contiguous but not
+    necessarily time-contiguous.
+  - If the timestamps are contiguous as well, then everything is fine and
+    nothing needs to be done.  This is the case where a file is being read
+    from disk, or capturing was done by an element that provided the clock.
+  - If they are not contiguous, then this element must make them so.
+    Since it should respect the nominal framerate, it has to stretch or
+    shorten the incoming data to match the timestamps set on the data.
+    For audio and video, this means it could interpolate or add/drop samples.
+    For audio, resampling/interpolation is preferred.
+    For video, a simple mechanism that chooses the frame with a timestamp as
+    close as possible to the theoretical timestamp could be used.
+  - When it receives a new buffer that is not data-contiguous with the
+    previous one, the capture element dropped samples/frames.
+    The adjuster can correct this by sending out as much "no-signal" data
+    (for audio, e.g. silence or background noise; for video, sending out
+    black frames) as it wants, since a data discontinuity is unrepairable.
+    So it can use these to catch up more aggressively.
+    It should just make sure that the next buffer it gets again goes
+    back to respecting the nominal framerate.
+
+- To achieve the best possible long-time capture, the following can be done:
+  - audiosrc captures audio and provides the clock.  It does contiguous
+    timestamping by default.
+  - videosrc captures video timestamped with the audiosrc's clock.  This data
+    feed doesn't match the nominal framerate.  If there is an encoding format
+    that supports storing the actual timestamps instead of pretending the
+    data flow respects the nominal framerate, this can be corrected after
+    recording.
+  - at the end of recording, the absolute length in time of both streams,
+    measured against a common clock, is the same or can be made the same by
+    chopping off data.
+  - the nominal rate of both audio and video is also known.
+  - given the length and the nominal rate, we have an evenly spaced list
+    of theoretical sampling points.
+  - video frames can now be matched to these theoretical sampling points by
+    interpolating or reusing/dropping frames.  It can choose the best
+    possible algorithm for this to decrease the visible effects
+    (interpolating results in blur, add/drop frames results in jerkiness).
+  - with the video resampled at the theoretical framerate, and the audio
+    already correct, the recording can now be muxed correctly into a format
+    that implicitly assumes a data rate matching the nominal framerate.
+  - One possibility is to use the GDP to store the recording, because that
+    retains all of the timestamping information.
+  - The process is symmetrical; if you want to use the clock provided by
+    the video capturer, you can stretch/shrink the audio at the end of
+    recording to match.
+
+TERMINOLOGY
+-----------
+- nominal rate
+  the framerate/samplerate
+  exposed in the caps; ie. the theoretical framerate of the
+  data flow.  This is the fps reported by the device or set for the encoder,
+  or the sampling rate of the audio device.
+- contiguous data flow
+  offset_end of old buffer matches offset of new buffer
+  for audio, this is a more important requirement, since you configure
+  output devices for a contiguous data flow.
+- contiguous time flow
+  T1 + D1 = T2
+  for video, this is a more important requirement, because the sampling
+  period is bigger, so it is more important to match the presentation time
+- "perfect stream"
+  data and time are contiguous and match the nominal rate
+  videotestsrc, sinesrc, filesrc ! decoder produce this
+
+NETWORK
+-------
+- elements can be synchronized by writing a NTP clock subclass that listens
+  to an ntp server, and tries to match its own clock against the NTP server
+  by doing gradual rate adjustment, compared with the own system clock.
+- sending audio and video over the network using tcpserversink is possible
+  when the streams are made to be perfect streams and synchronized.
+  Since the streams are perfect and synchronized, the timestamps transmitted
+  along with the buffers can be trusted.  The client just has to make
+  sure that it respects the timestamps.
+- One good way of doing that is to make an element that provides a clock
+  based on the timestamps of the data stream, interpolating using another
+  GstClock inbetween those time points.  This allows you to create
+  a perfect network stream player (one that doesn't lag (increasing buffers))
+  or play too fast (having an empty network queue).
+- On the client side, a GStreamer-ish way to do that is to cut the playback
+  pipeline in half, and have a decoupled element that converts
+  timestamps/durations (by resampling/interpolating/...) so that the sinks
+  consume data at the same rate the tcp sources provide it.
+  tcpclientsrc ! theoradec ! clocker name=clocker { clocker. ! xvimagesink }
+
+SYNCHRONISATION
+---------------
+- low rate source with high rate source:
+  the high rate source can drop samples so it starts with the same phase
+  as the low rate source.  This could be done in a synchronizer element.
+  example:
+  - audio, 8000 Hz, and video, 5 fps
+  - pipeline goes to playing
+  - video src does capture and receives its first frame 50 ms after playing
+    -> phase is -90 or 270 degrees
+  - to compensate, the equivalent of 150 ms of audio could be dropped so
+    that the first videoframe's timestamp coincides with the timestamp of
+    the first audio buffer
+  - this should be done in the raw audio domain since it's typically not
+    possible to chop off samples in the encoded domain
+
+- two low rate sources:
+  not possible to do this correctly, maybe something in the middle can be
+  found ?
+
+IMPROVING QUALITY
+-----------------
+- video src can capture at a higher framerate than will be encoded
+- this gives the corrector more frames to choose from or interpolate with
+  to match the target framerate, reducing jerkiness.
+  e.g. capturing at 15 fps for 5 fps framerate.
+
+LIVE CHANGES IN PIPELINE
+------------------------
+- case 1: video recording for some time, user wants to add audio recording on
+          the fly
+  - user sets complete pipeline to paused
+  - user adds element for audio recording
+  - new element gets same base time as video element
+  - on PLAYING, new element will be in sync and the first buffer produced
+    will have a non-zero timestamp that is the same as the first new video
+    buffer
+
+- case 2: video recording for some time, user wants to add in an audio file
+          from disk.
+  - two possible expectations:
+    A) user expects the audio file to "start playing now" and be muxed
+       together with the current video frames
+    B) user expects the audio file to "start playing from the point where the
+       video currently is" (ie, video is at 10 seconds, so mux with audio
+       starting from 10 secs)
+  - case A):
+    - complete pipeline gets paused
+    - filesrc ! dec added
+    - both get base_time same as video element
+    - pipeline to playing
+    - all elements receive new "now" as base_time so timestamps are reset
+    - muxer will receive synchronized data from both
+  - case B):
+    nothing gets paused
+    - filesrc ! dec added
+    - both get base_time that is the current clock time
+    - pipeline to playing
+    - core sets 
+    1) - new audio part starts sending out data with timestamp 0 from start
+      of file
+      - muxer receives a whole set of frames from the audio side that are late
+      (since the timestamps start at 0), so keeps dropping until it has
+      caught up with the current set).
+    OR
+    2) - audio part does clock query 
+
+THINGS TO DIG UP
+----------------
+- is there a better way to get at "when was this frame captured" then doing
+  a clock query after capturing ?
+  Imagine a video device with a hardware buffer of four frames.  If you
+  haven't asked for a frame from it in a while, three frames could be
+  queued up.  So three consecutive frame gets result in immediate returns
+  with pretty much the same clock query for each of them.
+  So we should find a way to get "a comparable clock time" corresponding
+  to the captured frame.
+
+- v4l2 api returns a gettimeofday() timestamp with each buffer.
+  Given that, you can timestamp the buffer by subtracting the delta
+  between the buffer's clock timestamp with the current system clock time,
+  from the current time reported by the provided clock.

+I'll use this doc to describe how I think media info should work from the
+perspective of the application developer and end user, and from that
+extrapolate what we need to provide that.
+
+RATIONALE
+---------
+One of the strong points of GStreamer is that it abstracts library dependencies
+away.  A user is free to choose whatever plug-ins he has, and a developer
+can code to the general API that GStreamer provides without having to deal
+with the underlying codecs.
+
+It is important that GStreamer also handles media info well and efficiently,
+since more often than not the same libraries are needed to do this.  So
+to avoid applications depending on these libs just to do the media info,
+we should make sure GStreamer provides a reasonable and fast abstraction
+for this as well.
+
+GOALS
+-----
+- quickly read and write "tags"
+- quickly read stream metadata (technical properties, length, audio props, ...)
+- cache both kinds of data transparently
+- (possibly) provide bins that do this
+- provide a simple API to do this
+
+DEFINITION OF TERMS
+-------------------
+The user or developer using GStreamer is interested in all information that
+describes the stream.  The library handles these two types differently
+however, so I will use the following terms to describe this :
+
+- metadata :
+  every kind of information that is tied to the "concept" of the stream,
+  and not tied to the actual encoding or representation of the stream.
+  - it can be altered without transcoding the stream
+  - it would stay the same for different encodings of the file
+  - describes properties of the information encoded into the stream
+  - examples:
+    - artist, title, author
+    - year, track order, album
+    - comments
+
+- mediainfo
+  every kind of information that is tied to the "codec" used.
+  - cannot be altered without transcoding
+  - is the set of parameters the stream has been encoded with
+  - describes properties of the encoded stream itself
+  - examples:
+    - bitrate targets (e.g. nominal), encoding mode (e.g. joint stereo)
+  - to this we also add "bitrate", but we query this through the pad_query
+    interface
+    
+- format
+  every kind of information that is tied to the "raw" bitstream
+  - cannot be altered without decoding and changing the raw bitstream
+  - examples:
+    - samplerate, bit depth/width, channels
+    - length in time
+    - video size, frames per second, colorspace used
+  - the format is queried by getting the GstCaps of the pad that sources
+    the buffers
+
+- length in time and tracks for the whole stream
+  - gotten through pad queries
+  - stored in variables in the struct
+
+- immediate info
+  - examples:
+    - position in time
+    - current bitrate
+
+- tracks :
+  a media file or stream can contain multiple consecutive streams, which
+  we will call "tracks".  GStreamer has a format for track used in querying
+  and seeking as well.
+  A track should be thought of as the whole of one single piece of media 
+  inside a physical stream.
+  A track can have at most one set of tags, and has fixed "raw" properties.
+
+EXAMPLE PIPELINES
+-----------------
+reading metadata : filesrc ! id3v1
+  - would read metadata from file
+  - id3v1 immediately causes filesrc to seek until it has found
+    - the (first) metadata
+    - that there is no metadata present
+  - id3v1 sends out a property notification with name "metadata" and
+    a GstCaps structure
+
+resetting and writing content metadata :
+	id3v1 reset=true artist="Arid" ! filesink
+
+  - effect: clear the current tag and reset it to only have Arid as artist
+  - id3v1 seeks to the right location, clears the tag, and writes the new one
+
+COST
+----
+Querying media info can be expensive.
+Any application querying for media info should take this into account and
+make sure that it doesn't block the app unnecessarily while the querying
+happens.
+
+The app should create an object, hand it a bunch of locations to query,
+and connect to the signal the app is going to send out.
+
+In most cases, querying content data should be fast since it doesn't involve
+decoding
+
+Technical data could be harder and thus might be better done only when needed.
+
+CACHE
+-----
+Getting media info can be an expensive operation.  It makes sense to cache
+the dia info queried on-disk to provide rapid access to this data.
+It is important however that this is done transparently - the system should
+be able to keep working without it, or keep working when you delete this cache.
+
+The API would provide a function like 
+	gst_media_info_read_cached (media_info, location, 
+                                    GST_MEDIA_INFO_METADATA, 
+                                    GST_MEDIA_INFO_READ_CACHED);
+
+to try and get the cached metadata using the media info object.
+
+- check if the file is cached in the media info cache
+  - if no, then read the media info and store it in the cache
+  - if yes, then check the file against it's timestamp (or (part of) md5sum ?)
+    - if it was changed, force a new read and store it in the cache
+    - if it wasn't changed, just return the cached media info
+
+
+For optimizations, it might also make sense to do 
+	GList * gst_metadata_read_many (media_info, GList *locations, ...)
+
+which would allow the back-end to implement this more efficiently.
+Suppose an application loads a playlist, for example, then this playlist
+could be handed to this function, and a GList of metadata types could
+be returned.
+
+Possible implementations :
+- one large XML file : would end up being too heavy
+- one XML file per dir on system : good compromise; would still make sense
+  to keep this in memory instead of reading and writing it all the time
+  Also, odds are good that users mostly use files from same dir in one app
+  (but not necessarily)
+
+Possible extra niceties :
+- matching of moved files, and a similar move of metadata (through user-space
+  tool ?)
+
+!!! For speed reasons, it might make sense to somehow keep the cache in memory
+instead of reparsing the same cache file each time.
+
+!!! For disk space reasons, it might make sense to have a system cache.
+Not sure if the complexity added is worth it though.
+
+!!! For disk space reasons, we might want to add an upper limit on the size of
+the cache.  For that we might need a timestamp on last retrieval of metadata,
+so that we can drop the old ones.
+
+The cache should use standard glibc.
+FIXME: is it worth it to use gnome-vfs for this ?
+
+STANDARDIZATION OF MEDIAINFO
+----------------------------
+Different file formats have different "tags".  It is not always possible
+to map metadata to tags.  Some level of agreement on metadata names is also
+required.
+
+For media info, the names or properties should be fairly standard.
+We also use the same names as used for properties and capabilities in 
+GStreamer.
+
+This means we use
+  - encoded audio
+    - "bitrate" (which is bits per second - use the most correct one,
+             ie. average bitrate for VBR for example)
+
+  - raw audio
+    - "samplerate" - sampling frequency
+    - "channels"
+    - "bitwidth" - how wide is the audio in bits
+
+  - encoded video
+    - "bitrate"
+
+  - raw video
+    (FIXME: I don't know enough about video, are these correct)
+    - "width"
+    - "height"
+    - "colordepth"
+    - "colorspace"
+    - "fps"
+    - "aspectratio"
+
+We must find a way to avoid collision.  A system stream can contain both
+audio and video (-> bitrate) or multiple audio or video streams.  One way
+to do this might be to make a metadata set for a stream a GList of metadata
+for elementary streams.
+
+For metadata and tags, the standards are less clear.
+Some nice ones to standardize on might be
+  - artist
+  - title
+  - author
+  - year
+  - genre (messy though)
+  - RMS, inpoint, outpoint (calculated through some formula, used for mixing)
+
+TESTING
+-------
+It is important to write a decent testsuite for this and do speed comparisons
+between the library used and the GStreamer implementation.

+Packaging guidelines for GStreamer
+----------------------------------
+
+Here are some guidelines for people trying to package GStreamer.
+
+VERSIONS
+--------
+
+First of all, there are two concepts of version in GStreamer.
+The first is the source package version; it is either of the form
+x.y.z or x.y.z.n
+
+x is the major number, y is the minor number, z is the micro number, and
+n (if it exists) is the nano number.
+
+In the first case, it is an official release of GStreamer.
+In the second case, it is a cvs version tarball if n == 1, and a prerelease
+for the next version if n > 1.
+
+Source releases where y is even are considered "stable", and source releases
+where y is uneven are considered "unstable" or "development".  This is similar
+to a lot of projects, including GLib and the kernel.
+
+The second version is an "interface" version, used in versioning tools, the
+library name, packages, GConf install paths, registry locations, and so on.
+It is of the form x.y
+Commonly, it is refered to as the "major/minor" number of GStreamer.
+In most cases it is the same as the one used in the source version; only
+when we are doing release candidates for a new major/minor source version do
+we manually force the major/minor to be the same as the one for the next
+new version.  This is done to shake out bugs that can arise due to this change
+before we do an actual x.y.0 release.
+
+PARALLEL INSTALLABILITY
+-----------------------
+Versions of GStreamer with a different "interface" or major/minor version are
+supposed to be parallel-installable.  If they're not then it's considered to
+be a bug.
+
+There are parallel-installable versions from the 0.6 set and onwards.
+
+In practice, this means that
+- libraries contain the major/minor version in their name
+- plugins are installed in a major/minor-versioned directory
+- include headers are installed in separate directories
+- registry is saved in major/minor-versioned locations
+- major/minor-versioned tools are installed, together with versioned man pages
+- non-versioned front-end tools are also installed, that call the
+  versioned ones, and only depend on glib and popt.
+
+So, all parts of GStreamer are parallel-installable, EXCEPT for the
+non-versioned tools and man pages.  However, only one of these sets needs
+to be present, and preferably the latest source version of them.
+
+PACKAGING
+---------
+To make packages of different major/minor versions parallel installable, the
+important part is to separate the package of the nonversioned tools and
+man pages, and make them usable for all the GStreamer library packages.
+
+We recommend putting the versioned binaries and man pages in the same package
+as the base GStreamer library.
+
+The base GStreamer library should require a version of the non-versioned tools,
+so that users can expect the non-versioned tools to be present in all cases,
+and our documentation agrees with the install.
+
+As for package names, we recommend the following system:
+
+- "gstreamer" as the base name should be used for the latest stable version
+  of GStreamer.
+- "gstreamerxy" should be used for all other versions (older stable version,
+  as well as current development version)
+
+As an example:
+  - 0.7 is current development version, and 0.6 is latest stable version:
+  "gstreamer" for 0.6 and "gstreamer07" for 0.7
+  - 0.8.0 gets released:
+  "gstreamer06" for 0.6, "gstreamer07" is kept for 0.7, and
+  "gstreamer" for 0.8, where:
+    - the 0.8 "gstreamer" package can now obsolete the 0.7 package
+    - the 0.6 "gstreamer06" package can obsolete previous "gstreamer" packages
+      with lower version/release
+
+This ensures that users who just want the latest stable version of GStreamer
+can just install the "gstreamer"-named set of packages, while automatic
+tools can still upgrade cleanly, maintaining compatibility for applications
+requiring older versions.
+
+This base named should be used for all GStreamer packages;
+for example gstreamer07-plugins is a package of plugins to work with
+the gstreamer07 base library package.
+
+SPLITTING OF PLUGIN PACKAGES
+----------------------------
+Since GStreamer can depend on, but isn't forced to depend on, more than
+40 additional libraries, choosing how to package these is a challenge
+compared to other projects.
+
+Three approaches have been used in the past.  One was "one package per
+dependency library", so that users could choose exactly what functionality
+they want installed.
+A second one was "split according to functionality".  This is more arbitrary.
+A third one, used by some distributors, is "put everything we want to ship
+in one big package".
+
+Packagers seem to agree that the first approach is too hard and users do not
+care this much about fine-grained control.
+We decided on a mix of 2) and 3); preferring to follow the base distribution's
+decision for the base -plugins package, then creating additional packages
+based on functionality.
+
+Plugins are put in -audio, -video, -dvd and -alsa packages.  Also, some
+plugins are put in -extras- packages because they are distributed from a
+different location, are not as well maintained, have other issues, ...
+
+In the case of Fedora, for example, mp3 plugins are shipped in -extras-audio,
+and distributed on FreshRPMS or rpm.livna.org
+For Mandrake, for example, they would be shipped from PLF.
+
+Now, to make sure other packages can require functionality they need,
+virtual provides are added for plugin packages, combining the base gstreamer
+name with the name of the actual GStreamer plugin.
+
+Assuming 0.7, and the mad plugin, the package "gstreamer07-plugins-extra-audio"
+would virtual-provide "gstreamer07-mad".  It would contain the file
+libgstmad.so in the correct directory.
+
+PACKAGING TIPS FOR RPMS
+-----------------------
+* use a define for the base package name for all GStreamer spec files:
+%define         gstreamer       gstreamer07
+* use a define for the major/minor version of the package:
+%define		majorminor	0.7
+
+This ensures you can easily migrate your spec files when a new major/minor
+version is released.
+
+* always use the correctly versioned gst-register-x.y tool in post scripts
+  that install plugins.
+  It helps to create a define for this as well:
+%define         register        %{_bindir}/gst-register-%{majorminor} > /dev/null 2>&1
+
+* make each package that installs plugins have (pre) and (post) requires
+  on the versioned register binary
+
+* make each package that installs plugins have a requires on the corresponding
+  base plugins package
+
+* make sure that the nonversioned tools and man pages are put in a package
+  that is named "gstreamer-tools" no matter what the major/minor version is.
+  This way, the latest version of this package can be used for all previous
+  major/minor packages.  If you do not want this package twice, with different
+  versions, then write your spec so that you don't package the tools for
+  previous versions, and only for the latest version.
+
+* applications that require specific plugins to function should require
+  the correct -plugins package, as well as any additional virtual provides
+  they need to pull in.
+
+* stable releases can obsolete: the previous development releases to ensure
+  they get removed when installing the new stable version.

+Some notes on use of pthreads in GStreamer
+------------------------------------------
+
+First off, pthreads are HARD.  Remember that.
+
+1) How I learned to debug glibc and pthreads and add debug code to it.
+
+You have to trick your GStreamer test app in running against a modified
+glibc.
+
+I used Red Hat 7.3, downloaded the .src.rpm, installed it, applied the
+patches included, and ran
+  ./configure --prefix=/home/thomas/cvs --with-add-ons
+  make
+  make install
+
+After quite some time this left me with recompiled libc and libpthread
+libraries in /home/thomas/cvs/lib, as well as a new ld-linux.so.2
+
+Now you need to use this new ld-linux.so ld loader to run your app,
+preferably from inside of gdb so you can tell what's going on when it
+crashes.
+
+You can use ld-linux.so.2 to call your binaries:
+  ld-linux.so.2 .libs/thread1
+to run the thread1 program with the new glibc.
+
+If this is a GStreamer app, chances are it might not find some libraries
+it needs that you could safely use from /usr/lib (like, zlib and popt).
+
+Also, you want it to run in gdb, so this is my full line:
+
+LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib /home/thomas/cvs/lib/ld-linux.so.2 \
+  /usr/bin/gdb .libs/thread1 
+
+At this point you can start adding debug code to the pthreads implementation
+in your glibc source tree.  Just change, re-run make install, and restart
+the test app in gdb.
+
+Helpful --gst-mask is 0x00200100 to get thread info and scheduling info
+(with mem alloc from cothreads)
+
+2) What GStreamer does with pthreads.
+
+Apps create a thread with gst_thread_new.  This just allocates the GstThread
+structure without actually doing much with it.
+
+When a thread goes from NULL to READY, the gst_thread_change_state function
+creates the actual pthread.
+  - we lock the thread->lock mutex
+  - we create attributes for the pthread
+    - by default the pthread is JOINABLE
+    - we ask the thread's scheduler for a preferred stack size and location
+      (FIXME: if the scheduler doesn't return one, what do we do ?)
+    - we create the pthread with the given attributes
+      - the pthread id is stored in thread->thread_id
+      - the created pthread starts executing gst_thread_main_loop (thread)
+    - the change_state function does a g_cond_wait
+      - this means it unlocks the mutex, waits until thread->cond is set
+        (which happens in gst_thread_main_loop), 
+        then relocks the mutex and resumes execution
+
+From the point of view of the created pthread, here's what happens.
+gst_thread_main_loop (thread) gets called
+  - the thread's mutex gets locked
+  - the thread's scheduler's policy gets examined
+  - the scheduler gets set up (invokes the scheduler object's setup method)
+    FIXME: what are the prereqs of this _setup method ?
+    - basic and fast scheduler both call do_cothread_context_init
+      - basic: this calls cothread_context_init
+        - cothread_context_init
+      - fast: this calls cothread_create (NULL, 0, NULL, NULL))

+1) Goal:
+========
+The goal of this document is to analyze current problems
+in media type detection as we currently handle it in
+GStreamer (as of 27/9/2003), and how these can be solved.
+This touches upon typefinding, autoplugging and (optionally)
+bytestream.
+
+2) Typefinding, bytestream & autoplugging:
+==========================================
+
+bytestream:
+-----------
+currently, bytestream collects incoming buffers and adds
+them up (gst_buffer_merge ()). From this, a subbuffer is
+created, which is inexpensive. In case of filesrc, the
+merging is not expensive, too (mmap ()). However, in any
+other source case, _merge () needs a new buffer plus copy
+of the data. This is plain wrong. Source elements need to
+be able to support a _read ()- instead of a _get ()-based
+way of providing data to the pipeline on their choice. To
+the rest of GStreamer, _get () and _read () are the same,
+the only difference is that _read () also requests a size
+of the buffer to be returned.
+
+Surely, this does not mean that bytestream will read any
+buffer size that is requested from it plainly, this would
+be ineffective. It is still allowed to cache (although the
+kernel will do this too...).
+
+typefinding:
+------------
+the typefind function type is currently defined as:
+
+typedef stuct _GstTypeDefinition {
+  gchar *name;
+  gchar *mimetype;
+  gchar *extension;
+  GstTypefindFunc func;
+} GstTypeDefinition;
+
+typedef (GstCaps *) (* GstTypefindFunc) (GstBuffer *buffer,
+					 gpointer   private);
+
+GstTypeFactory * gst_type_factory_new (GstTypeDefinition *def);
+
+Although is is unclear what private is and how to use it
+in a plugin. ;). The current approach has one large
+disadvantage: the plugin cannot control the input for type
+detection. Therefore, if the incoming buffer is not large
+enough, typefinding will inappropriately fail. This is
+unacceptable. The plugin needs to control input data flow
+itself, so that we will have less false negatives and/or
+will need only one cycle through the plugins to find the
+type of a data stream.
+
+Therefore, I propose the following change to the typefind
+system:
+
+typedef (GstCaps *) (* GstTypefindFunc) (GstBytestream *input,
+					 gpointer       private);
+
+and 
+
+GstTypeFactory * gst_type_factory_new (GstTypeDefinition *definition,
+				       gpointer           data);
+
+The data gpointer will be provided as second argument to the
+typefind function and is for private use to the plugin.
+
+There is one rule: at the end of typefinding, the plugin needs
+to take care that the state of the bytestream is exactly the
+same as before typefinding. It may cache data, but it may not
+skip (and therefore lose) data. If the bytestream supports
+seeking, this is easy: simply seek back to 0 (start of stream)
+after typefinding. If it does not, then you need to assure
+that you only used _peek (), not _read () or _flush ().
+
+The caller of the typefind function is responsible for creating
+the bytestream and for emptying the cache and reusing it in the
+data stream after the typefind function returns.
+
+spider:
+-------
+Imo, spider should use GstTypefind (a public element) for
+typefinding. Ideally, it would derive from it.
+
+GstTypefind emits a signal when a type is found, and furtherly
+only has a sink pad. the derived elements from this should
+implement anything needed to make a proper autoplugger.
+
+3) Status of this document

+Proposal, pending to be implemented. Target release is 0.8.0 or
+any 0.7.x release.

+GstTypes exist to try to make sure data eveyrone is talking about the
+right kind of data.  They aid quite a bit in autoplugging, in fact make it
+possible.  Each well-formed type includes a function (typefind) that will
+take one or more buffers and determine whether or not it is indeed a
+stream of that type, and possible a metadata to go with it.  It may
+provide related metadata structure IDs (and must if it provides metadata
+from the typefind function).
+
+Because multiple elements and plugins are very likely to be using the same
+types, the process of creating/finding types is designed to be done with a
+single function call.  All operations on GstTypes occur via their guint16
+ID numbers, with the GstType structure "private" to the GST library.  A
+plugin wishing to use a give type would contain a static struct of type
+GstTypeFactory, which lists the MIME type, possible extensions (which may
+overlap the mime-types file), a typefind function, and any other cruft I
+decide to add.
+
+A plugin init function would take this typefactory and hand it to the
+gst_type_new() (FIXME: badly named) function, which would first search for
+that same MIME type in the current list.  If it found one, it would
+compare the two to see if the new one is "better".  Better is defined as
+having more extentions (to be merged) or a typefind function verses none.
+
+The point of returning an existing MIME type is a result of the goal of
+unifying types enough to guarantee that, for instance, all MP3 decoders
+will work interchangably.  If MP3 decoder A says "MIME type 'audio/mpeg'
+with extensions 'mpeg3'" and decoder B says "MIME type 'audio/mpeg' with
+extensions 'mp3'", we don't want to have two types defined, possibly with
+two typefind functions. If we did, it's not obvious which of the two would
+be tried first (luck) and if both would really identify streams as mp3
+correctly in all cases.  And whichever wins, we're stuck using the
+associated decoder to play that stream.  We lose the choice between any
+valid mp3 decoder, and thus the whole point of the type system.

+OUTDATED
+--------
+
+
+1. Introduction
+---------------
+
+The type system is used to attach meaning to the bytes in a GstBuffer.
+A plugin can decide to add metadata to the GstBuffer, this metadata
+will carry an associated typeid.
+
+Types are also used by the plugins to expose the type of their pads to
+the type system.
+
+Types are essential for autoplugging. 
+
+We will explain the inner workings of the type system in this document, as
+well as the API used in the plugins.
+
+
+2. Type properties
+------------------
+
+a) identification of the type
+
+  Types are identified by one or more MIME types. 
+
+b) detection of types
+
+  The type of any given GstBuffer can be detected using
+
+    - a typefind function: a function that will inspect the bytes
+           in the buffer and return a gboolean indicating the
+	   buffer is of the given type.
+
+    - a template for the bytes/bits in the data that must be
+           satisfied in order for the GstBuffer to be of the given 
+	   type.
+  
+    - other properties that act more like a hint like:
+           the extension of the source filename.
+	   the URI of the source.
+
+
+3. Type registration
+--------------------
+
+a) the core libraries will create to types:
+
+   video/raw image/raw
+   audio/raw
+
+b) all other types will be provided by the plugins
+
+before a type can become available to other plugins, the plugin
+has to register the type. 
+
+The system will keep a directed graph of the types and the plugins
+that operate on them.
+
+example:
+
+                     video/mpeg
+                         ! 
+		     mpeg1parse
+		      /     \
+	      video/mpeg1   audio/mp3 -----\
+	      !        !           \        !
+	 mpeg_play   mpeg2dec      mpg123   xing  ...
+              \        /              \     /		        
+              video/raw              audio/raw-----\
+	      !      !                   !         !
+        videosink   SDLsink           audiosink    alsasink ...
+			
+
+The system can find the needed plugins to convert video/mpeg to
+audio/raw using this graph.
+
+
+4. type equivalence
+-------------------
+
+some types can have the same meaning for example:
+
+  audio/mp3 and audio/mpeg 
+
+or
+
+  video/raw and image/raw
+  
+
+a plugin that exposes its output type as audio/mpeg and another plugins
+with input type audio/mp3 can be connected. The system has to know about
+the equivalence of both types, even it they have a different mime type.
+
+ 
+5. type hierarchy
+-----------------
+
+some plugins can ouput a specific subset of an allready existing type.
+
+example:
+
+  mp3parse inputs audio/mp3 and packs the stream into mp3 audio frames
+  with mime type: audio/mp3-frame
+
+  mpg123 only accepts audio/mp3-frame but not audio/mp3.
+
+  another mp3 decoder (libmpg123) can accept audio/mp3 (and thus also 
+  audio/mp3-frame)
+
+  it must be possible to connect both libmpg123 and mpg123 to the mp3parse
+  element.
+  it must not be possible to connect mpg123 to an element that outputs only
+  audio/mp3 but not audio/mp3-frame.
+
+
+We say that audio/mp3-frame is a more specific subset of type audio/mp3.
+
+we can create a type hierarchy:
+
+          audio/mp3
+         /        \
+  audio/mp3-frame  audio/mp3-layer12
+                     /        \
+	   audio/mp3-layer1    audio/mp3-layer2
+
+
+6. multi-type pads
+------------------
+
+certain plugins might accept multiple non equivalent types in one of their
+input pads. Consequently a plugin might output non equivalent types in
+its output pad.
+
+It must therefore be possible to specify multiple types for a pad.
+
+example:
+
+  mpegdemux may be able to demux both MPEG1 and MPEG2 system streams.
+  we show the type hierarchy of the video/mpeg as follows:
+
+                          video/mpeg
+		         /        \
+               video/mpeg1         video/mpeg2 ---------------\
+	       /    \                    /    \               !
+      mpeg1-system*  mpeg1-video    mpeg2-ts   mpeg2-ps*    mpeg2-video
+
+
+  the mpegdemux element might specify the type of the input pad as 
+  one of video/mpeg1-system and video/mpeg2-ts
+
+
+
+7. definition of types
+----------------------
+
+A plugin will provide the following information to the type system:
+
+ - a mime type string describing the hierarchy and where the types
+   they provide are located in that hierarchy.
+
+ - typefind functions for some of the types.
+
+ - extensions for some of the types
+
+We will propose a syntax to define the type hierarchy
+
+a) equivalent types :
+
+   separated with a | sign
+
+   ( audio/mp3 | audio/mpeg )
+
+b) type hierarchy :
+
+   in braces:
+
+   ( audio/mp3 ( audio/mp3-frame))
+
+c) multi-type pads
+
+  ( mpegdemux ( video/mpeg1-system + video/mpeg2-ps) )
+
+  the pad will have type mpegdemux which is the parent for
+  type video/mpeg1-system or video/mpeg2-ps
+
+                  mpegdemux
+          	  /       \
+ video/mpeg1-system      video/mpeg2-ps
+   
+
+   
+once the type hierarchy has been registered, the typeid of each
+element can be obtained with:
+
+  guint16 gst_type_find_by_mime (gchar *mime)
+
+extra typefind functions and/or extensions can be added to the 
+typeid afterwards.
+
+
+8. type matching
+----------------
+
+The more specific typefind functions, the functions associated with
+types in the leaf nodes, are tried first.
+
+when a specific type has been found ex. video/mpeg1-system elements
+that can handle this type or one of its parents are selected:
+
+  mpegdemux:                     mpeg1parse:                    supermpegdecoder:
+
+    video/mpeg                       video/mpeg                   video/mpeg
+     !                                  !
+    mpegdemux                        video/mpeg1-system
+     !                                 
+    video/mpeg1-system         
+
+In the above case, also the super mpeg element is selected because it stated
+that it can handle all sorts of video/mpeg data. 
+
+
+example 2:
+
+   suppose the typefind functions finds an mp3 stream, fillowing elments
+   are selected:
+
+       libmpg123              mp3parse:
+
+       audio/mp3              audio/mp3
+ 
+   mpg123 is not selected because its pad type is too specific (audio/mp3-frame):
+
+       mpg123
+
+       audio/mp3
+         !
+       audio/mp3-frame
+
+   if the typefind would find a mp3-frame type, all three objects would be selected.
+
+
+8. consideration
+----------------
+
+It is clear that clear indications have to be given to the type hierarchy,
+especially for the top nodes.
+
+The more specific an element is in its mime type specification, the more flexible 
+and extendible the plugin system can be.

+SOMEWHAT OUTDATED, design still holds though
+--------------------------------------------
+
+
+1. Introduction
+---------------
+
+The type system is used to attach meaning to the bytes in a GstBuffer.
+A plugin can decide to add metadata to the GstBuffer, this metadata
+will carry an associated typeid.
+
+Types are also used by the plugins to expose the type of their pads to
+the type system.
+
+Types are essential for autoplugging. 
+
+We will explain the inner workings of the type system in this document, as
+well as the API used in the plugins.
+
+2. major types
+--------------
+
+major types are identified with mime types and are used to denote a 
+family of types.
+
+More specific information about the type is given using properties. This
+will allow us to be very specific without creating a lot of mime types.
+
+3. API
+------
+
+Both a simple array based specification and a real API will be
+provided to build the capabilities. 
+
+In the array based approach, we basically build an array of pointers.
+Some macros will be available to specify ranges, boolean values, lists
+and id's. (not sure if this can be done)
+
+#define GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE(a, b) GST_TYPE_RANGE,(a),(b)
+#define GST_TYPE_BOOLEAN(a) GST_TYPE_BOOLEAN,(a)
+#define GST_TYPE_LIST(a...) GST_TYPE_LIST,(##a),NULL
+
+for example:
+
+  static GstTypeCapsFactory mpg123_sink_caps[] = {
+    "audio/mp3",
+    "layer", 	GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE (1, 3),
+    "bitrate",	GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE (8, 320),
+    "framed",	GST_TYPE_BOOLEAN (true),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+will expand to the array:
+
+  static GstTypeCapsFactory mpg123_sink_caps[] = {
+    "audio/mp3",
+    "layer", 	GST_TYPE_RANGE,1,3,
+    "bitrate",	GST_TYPE_RANGE,8,320,
+    "famed",	GST_TYPE_BOOLEAN,true,
+    NULL,
+  };
+
+when we register the caps factory, the strings will be converted
+into GQuarks and be stored into a GData Keyed Data List.
+
+This will result in a GstTypeCaps structure:
+
+struct _GstTypeCaps {
+  guint16 id;                 // if of the major type 
+
+  GData *properties;
+}
+
+4. example using arrays
+-----------------------
+
+mpg123: an mpeg audio decoder.
+
+  // a factory for the major type we use
+  static GstTypeFactory mp3factory = {
+    "audio/mp3",		// major type
+    ".mp3 .mp2 .mp1 .mpga",	// extenstions
+    NULL,			// typefind function
+  };
+
+  // capabilities of the sink pad
+  static GstTypeCapsFactory mpg123_sink_caps[] = {
+    "audio/mp3",
+    "layer", 	GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE (1, 3),
+    "bitrate",	GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE (8, 320),
+    "framed",	GST_TYPE_BOOLEAN (true),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+  // capabilities of the source pad
+  static GstTypeCapsFactory mpg123_src_caps[] = {
+    "audio/raw",
+    "rate", 	GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE (8000, 48000),
+    "channels",	GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE (1, 2),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+  static GstTypeCaps *sinkcaps = NULL, *rawcaps = NULL;
+
+  static gst_mpg123_init (GstMpg123 *mpg123) 
+  {
+    mpg123->sinpad = gst_pad_new ("sink", GST_PAD_SINK);
+    gst_element_add_pad (GST_ELEMENT (mpg123), mpg123->sinkpad);
+    gst_pad_set_caps (mpg123->sinkpad, sinkcaps);
+
+    ...
+  }
+
+  GstPlugin *plugin_init (GModule *module)
+  {
+    ...
+    plugin = gst_plugin_new ("mpg123");
+   
+    gst_plugin_add_type_factory (plugin, mp3factory);
+  
+    ...
+    sinkcaps = gst_type_register_caps (mpg123_sink_caps, NULL);
+    rawcaps  = gst_type_register_caps (mpg123_src_caps, NULL);
+    ...
+  }
+
+mpeg2dec: an mpeg video decoder that can do mpeg1 and mpeg2.
+
+  static GstTypeFactory mpegfactory = {
+    "video/mpeg",		// major type
+    ".mpg .mpeg",		// extenstions
+    NULL,			// typefind function
+  };
+
+  static GstTypeCapsFactory mpeg2dec_sink_caps[] = {
+    "video/mpeg",
+    "mpegtype", GST_TYPE_LIST (
+                        GST_TYPE_INT(1),
+                        GST_TYPE_INT(2),
+			),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+  static GstTypeCapsFactory mpeg2dec_src_caps[] = {
+    "video/raw",
+    "fourcc", 	GST_TYPE_LIST (
+                        GST_TYPE_INT32 (0x32315659), 
+			GST_TYPE_INT32 (0x32...), 
+			),
+    "width",	GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE (16, 4096),
+    "height",	GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE (16, 4096),
+    NULL
+  };
+
+  static GstTypeCaps *sinkcaps = NULL, *rawcaps = NULL;
+
+  GstPlugin *plugin_init (GModule *module)
+  {
+    ...
+    plugin = gst_plugin_new ("mpeg2dec");
+   
+    ...
+    sinkcaps = gst_type_register_caps (mpeg2dec_sink_caps, NULL);
+    rawcaps  = gst_type_register_caps (mpeg2dec_src_caps, NULL);
+    ...
+  }
+
+
+5. capabilty compatibility
+--------------------------
+
+Two pads are compatible if:
+
+- The major types are equal
+- range of the sink pad contains the range of the src pad

+About MIDI
+----------
+
+MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is used mainly as a communications
+protocol for devices in a music studio. These devices could be physical entities
+(e.g. synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) or purely logical (e.g. sequencers or
+filter banks implemented as software applications).
+
+The MIDI specification essentially consists of a list of MIDI messages that can
+be passed among devices ; these messages (also referred to as "events") are
+usually things like NoteOn (start playing a sound), NoteOff (stop playing a
+sound), Clock (for synchronization), ProgramChange (for signaling an instrument
+or program change), etc.
+
+MIDI is different from other cross-device or inter-process streaming methods
+(e.g. JACK and possibly some CORBA implementations) because MIDI messages are
+discrete and usually only exchanged a few times per second ; the devices
+involved are supposed to interpret the MIDI messages and produce sounds or
+signals. The devices in a MIDI chain typically send their audio signals out on
+separate (physical) cables or (logical) channels that have nothing to do with
+the MIDI chain itself.
+
+We want to have MIDI messages available in GStreamer pipelines because MIDI is a
+common protocol in many existing studios, and MIDI is more or less a standard
+for inter-device communications. With MIDI support in GStreamer we can look
+forward to (a) controlling and being controlled by external devices like
+keyboards and sequencers, and (b) synchronizing and communicating among multiple
+applications on a studio computer.
+
+GStreamer and MIDI
+------------------
+
+MIDI could be thought of in terms of dataflow as a sparse, non-constant flow of
+bytes. GStreamer works best with near-constant data flow, so a MIDI stream would
+probably have to consist mostly of filler events, sent at a constant tick rate.
+It makes the most sense at this point to distribute MIDI events in a GStreamer
+pipeline as a sequence of subclasses of GstEvent (GstMidiEvent or suchlike).
+
+On-the-wire hardware MIDI connections run at a fixed data rate:
+
+  The MIDI data stream is a unidirectional asynchronous bit stream at 31.25
+  Kbits/sec. with 10 bits transmitted per message (a start bit, 8 data bits, and
+  one stop bit).
+
+Which is to say, 3125 bytes/sec. I would assume that the rawmidi interface would
+already filter out the stop and start bits? dunno. How about the diagram on[1],
+I found that to be useful. The MIDI specification is also available (though I
+can't find it online at the moment ... might have to buy a copy), and there are
+several tutorial and help pages (just google for MIDI tutorial).
+
+There's another form of MIDI (the common usage?), "Standard MIDI files," which
+essentially specify how to save and restore MIDI events in a file. We'll talk
+about that in a bit.
+
+[1] http://www.philrees.co.uk/#midi
+
+MIDI and current Linux/Unix audio systems
+-----------------------------------------
+
+We don't know very much about the OSS MIDI interface; apparently there exists an
+evil /dev/sequencer interface, and maybe a better /dev/midi* one. I only know
+this from overhearing it from people. For latency reasons, the ALSA MIDI
+interface will be much more solid than using these devices ; however, the
+/dev/midi* devices might be more of a cross-platform standard.
+
+ALSA has a couple ways to access MIDI devices. One way is the sequencer API.
+There's a tutorial[1], and some example code[2] -- the paradigm is 'wait on some
+event fd's until you get an event, then process the event'. Not very
+GStreamer-like. This API timestamps the events, much like Standard MIDI files.
+
+The other way to use MIDI with alsa is with the rawmidi interface. There is a
+canonical reference[3] and example code, too[4]. This is much more like
+GStreamer. I do wonder about the ability to connect to other sequencer clients,
+though...

+
+Getting MIDI into GStreamer
+---------------------------
+
+All buffers are timestamped, and MIDI buffers should be no exception. A buffer
+with MIDI data will have a timestamp which says exactly when the data should be
+played. In some cases this would mean a buffer contains just a couple of bytes
+(eg, NoteOn). If this turns out to be inefficient we can deal with that later.
+
+In addition to integrating more tightly with GStreamer audio pipelines (see the
+dparams and midi2pcm sections below), there are several elements that we will
+need for basic MIDI interaction in GStreamer. These basics include file parsing
+and encoding (is that the opposite of parsing ?), and direct hardware input and
+output. We'll also probably need a more generic sequencer interface for defining
+elements that are capable of sending and receiving this type of nonlinear stream
+information.
+
+For these tasks, we need to define some MIME types, some general properties, and
+some MIDI elements for GStreamer.
+
+Types :
+
+- MIDI being passed to/from a text file : audio/midi (This is in my midi.types
+  file, associated with a .midi or .mid extension. It seems analogous to a .wav
+  file, which contains "audio/x-wav" type information.)
+
+- MIDI in a pipeline : audio/x-gst-midi ?
+
+Properties :
+
+- tick rate : (default to 96.0, or something like that) This is measured in
+  ticks per quarter note (or "pulses per quarter note" (ppqn) to be picky). We
+  should use float for this so we can support nonstandard (fractional)
+  tempos.
+
+- tempo : (default to 120 bpm) This can be measured in bpm (beats per minute,
+  the musician's viewpoint), or mpq (microseconds per quarter note, the unit
+  used in a MIDI file[1]). Seems like we might want a query format for these
+  different units ? Or maybe we should just use MPQ and leave it to apps to do
+  conversions ?
+
+Elements :
+
+- midiparse : audio/midi -> audio/x-gst-midi
+
+  This element converts MIDI information from a file into MIDI signals that can
+  be passed around in GStreamer pipelines. This would parse so-called Standard
+  MIDI files (and XML format MIDI files ?). Standard MIDI files are just
+  timestamped MIDI data; they don't run at a constant bitrate, and for that
+  reason you need this element.
+
+  The timestamps that this element produces would be based on the tempo
+  property, and the time deltas of the MIDI file data. If no data exists for a
+  given tick, the element can just send a filler event.
+
+  The element should support both globbing and streaming the file. Streaming it
+  is the most GStreamerish way of handling it, but there are MIDI file formats
+  which are by definition unstreamable, therefore a MIDI plugin needs to support
+  streaming and globbing - and globbing might be easiest to implement first. The
+  modplug plugin also reads an entire file before playing so its a valid
+  technique.
+
+- ossmidisink : audio/x-gst-midi -> hardware
+
+  Could be added to the existing OSS plugin dir, sends MIDI data to the OSS MIDI
+  sequencer device (/dev/midi). Makes extensive use of GstClock to send out data
+  only when the buffer/event timestamp says it should. (Could instead use the
+  raw MIDI device for clocking, doesn't matter which.)
+
+- alsamidisink : audio/x-gst-midi -> ALSA rawmidi API
+
+  Guess what this does. Don't know whether alsa's sequencer interface would be
+  better than its rawmidi one. Probably rawmidi?
+
+- ossmidisrc, alsamidisrc : hardware -> audio/x-gst-midi
+
+  Real time midi input. This needs to be from the rawmidi APIs.
+
+It seems like we could implement a class hierarchy around these elements. We
+could use a GstMidiElement superclass, which would include the above properties
+and contain utility functions for things like reading from the clock and
+converting between different time measurement units. From this element we ought
+to have GstMidiSource, GstMidiFilter, and GstMidiSink parent classes. (Maybe
+that's overkill ?) Each of these MIDI elements listed above could then inherit
+from an appropriate superclass.
+
+We also need an interface (GstSequencer) to allow multiple implementations for
+one of the most common MIDI tasks (duh, sequencing). The midisinks could
+implement this interface, as could other soft-sequencer elements like
+playondemand. The sequencer interface needs to be able to support MIDI
+sequencing tasks, but it should support more generic sequencing concepts.
+
+As you might have guessed, getting MIDI support into GStreamer is thus a matter
+of (a) creating a series of elements that handle MIDI data, and (b) creating a
+sort of MIDI library (like Timidity ?) that basically includes #defines for MIDI
+message codes and stuff like that. This stuff should be coded in the gst-plugins
+module, under gst-libs/gst/sequencer (for the interface) and
+gst-libs/gst/audio/midi/ (for the defines and superclasses).
+
+Of course, this is just the basics ... read on for the really gory future stuff.
+:)
+
+[1] http://www.borg.com/~jglatt/tech/midifile/ppqn.htm
+
+Looking ahead
+-------------
+
+- MIDI to PCM
+
+It would be nice to be able to transform MIDI (audio/midi) to audio
+(audio/x-raw-{int|float}), which could be further processed in a GStreamer
+pipeline. In effect this would be using GStreamer as some kind of softsynth.
+
+The first way to do this would be to send MIDI data to softsynths and get audio
+data out. There's a very, very nice way of doing this in ALSA (the sequencer
+API). Timidity can already register itself as a sequencer client, as can
+amSynth, AlsaModularSynth, SpiralSynth, etc... and these latter ones are *much*
+more interesting. This is the proper, IMHO, way of doing things.
+
+But, the other question is getting that data back for use by GStreamer. In that
+sense a librafied Timidity would be useful, I guess... see the thing is that all
+of these sequencer clients probably want to output to the sound card directly,
+although they are configurable. In this, the musician's only hope is Jack. If
+the synth is jacked up, we can get its output back into GStreamer. If not, oh
+well, it's gone ...
+
+- MIDI to dparams
+
+Once we have MIDI streams, we can start doing fun things like writing a
+midi2dparams element which would map midi data to control the dynamic parameters
+of other elements, but lets not get ahead of ourselves.
+
+Which gets back to MIDI. MIDI is a representation of control signals. So all you
+need are elements to convert that representation to control signals. In
+addition, you'd probably want something like SuperCollider's Voicer element --
+see [1] for more information on that.
+
+All of this is pretty specific to a synthesizer system, and rightly so :
+multiple projects use it it could go in some kind of library or what-what but
+otherwise it can stay in individial projects.
+
+[1] http://www.audiosynth.com/schtmldocs/Help/Unit_Generators/Spawners/Voicer.help.html
+
+On using dparams for MIDI
+-------------------------
+
+You might might want to look into using dparams if:
+
+- you wanted your control parameters to change at a higher rate thanyour buffer
+  rate (think zipper noise and sample-granularity-interpolation)
+- you wanted a better way to store and represent control data than midifiles
+- We wrote a linear interpolation time-aware dparam so that we could really
+  demonstrate what they're good for.
+
+It was always the intention for dparams to be able to send values to and get
+values from pads. All we need is some simple elements to do the forwarding.
+
+Possible inefficiency remedy : GstControlPad
+--------------------------------------------
+
+If it turns out that sending MIDI events spaced out with filler (blank) events
+isn't efficient enough, we'll need to look into implementing something new ; for
+now, though, we'll just try the simple approach and hope our CPUs are fast
+enough. But read on for a little brainstorming.
+
+It seems like GStreamer could benefit from a different subclass of GstPad,
+something like GstControlPad. Pads of this type could contain control data like
+parameters for oscillators/filters, MIDI events, text information for subtitles,
+etc. The defining characteristic of this type of data is that it operates at a
+much lower sample rate than the multimedia data that GStreamer currently
+handles.I think that control data can be sent down existing pads without making
+any changes.
+
+GstControlPad instances could also contain a default value like Wingo has been
+pondering, so apps wouldn't need to connect actual data to the pads if the
+default value sufficed. There could also be some sweet integration with dparams,
+it seems like.If you want a default value on a control pad, just make the source
+element send the value when the state changes. Elements that have control pads
+could also have standard GstPads, and I'd imagine there would need to be some
+scheduler modifications to enable the lower processing demands of control pads.
+
+An example : integrating amSynth[1]
+-----------------------------------
+
+We would want to be able to write amSynth as a plugin. This would require that
+when the process function is called, we have a MIDI buffer as input, containing
+how ever many MIDI events occurred in, say, 1/100 sec for example, and then we
+generate an audio buffer of the same time duration...)
+
+Maybe this will indicate the kind of problems to be faced. GStreamer has solved
+this problem for audio/video syncing, so you should probably do it the same way.
+The first task would be to make this pipeline work:
+
+  filesrc location=foo.mid ! midiparse ! amSynth ! osssink
+
+midiparse will take MIDI file data as an input, and produce timestamped MIDI
+buffers as output. It could have a beats-per-minute property as mentioned above
+to specify how the MIDI beat offsets are converted to timestamps.
+
+An amSynth element should be a loop element. It would read MIDI buffers until it
+has more than enough to produce audio for the duration of one audio buffer. It
+knows it has enough MIDI buffers by looking at the timestamp. Because amSynth is
+setting the timestamps on the audio buffers going out, a MIDI sink element would
+know when to play them. Once this is working, a more challenging pipeline might
+be :
+
+  alsamidisrc ! amSynth ! alsasink
+
+This would be a real-time pipeline : any MIDI input should instantly be
+transformed into audio. You would have small audio buffers for lowlatency (64
+samples seems to be typical).
+
+This is a problem for amSynth because it can't sit there waiting for more MIDI
+just in case there is more than one MIDI event per audio buffer. In this case
+you could either :
+
+- listen to the clock so you know when its time to output the buffer
+- have some kind of real-time mode for amSynth which doesn't wait forMIDI events
+  which may never come
+- have alsamidisrc produce empty timestamped MIDI buffers so that amSynth knows
+  that is time to spit out some audio.
+

+
+Extended midi files : .kar and karaoke
+-----------------------------------
+
+KAR files are standard MIDI files that also contain a stream with lyrics, for karaoke, 
+synchronised on music. MIDI players play them without any problem, ignoring the
+additional data.
+
+It is the more widespread karaoke file format. (one other beeing .kok files, for mp3)
+
+KAR files are based on standard MIDI files with the following additional events:
+ 
+The KAR text meta events start with an @ followed by a character indicating
+the type of KAR text meta event, then followed by text for that event.  The
+following text meta events occur embedded in regular MIDI text events:
+ 
+FileType:     @KMIDI KARAOKE FILE
+Version:      @V0100
+Information:  @I<text>
+Language:     @LENGL
+Title 1:      @T<title>
+Title 2:      @T<author>
+Title 3:      @T<copyright>
+ 
+The following lyric text indicators are defined.  A \ (backslash) in the
+text is to clear the screen. A / (forwardslash) in the text is a line feed
+(next line).

+Duh, an 'easy' way to replicate Giess's behavior:
+
+For each frame, you have to mutate it by a transform matrix.  This is
+easy, thought not cheap.  First you precalculate the transform matrix how
+you want it, based on whatever rotations or whatever you want.
+
+The data stored in each spot on the matrix tells you how to transform a
+single pixel.  The simple case is dx,dy, where both are relatively small.
+The probably ought to be a byte in any case, so you can scale the
+transform matrix on slow machines.  A more complex case is some trick
+whereby a single pixel ends up splattered in several places.  Idea below.
+
+The matrix consists of some number of 8bit arrays of the same size as the
+image.  They'd probably be line-interleaved or better to help with cache
+effects (which are VERY serious here).  Each channel represents some
+aspect of the transform. The first two would likely be dx and dy, the
+third might be a multiplier if that wasn't done statically.
+
+The idea: any number of transform sets could be applied, given available
+processing power.  Just set the static scalar or the multiplier matrices
+so you don't completely swamp the output pixels.
+
+Note that this is fastest in 8-bit, but theoretically could be applied to
+32 bit.  15 and 16 are hard, since you can't easily apply the multipliers
+unless they're 1/2^n, and even then it's significantly heavier (you'd have
+to mask the top n bits of each color out).
+
+This SCREAMS for MMX, in case you haven't figured it out yet.
+Unfortunatley, MMX is only directly useful for the scalar matrix, unless
+you do a trick where all the pixels in that fit in 64 bits (8 8bit, 4
+16bit, or 2 32bit) are always moved in a group.  This is very possible,
+and might be a significant perf increase by being able to use MMX all the
+way through.  Otherwise you have to place each pixel by extracting the MMX
+stuff back into normal registers, and that just plain sucks.
+
+A pseudo-C implementation:
+
+----- BEGIN -----
+gint x,y;				/* image x and y size */
+guchar old_image[x][y];			/* original image */
+guchar new_image[x][y];			/* new image */
+gchar x_xform[x][y];			/* dx matrix */
+gchar y_xform[x][y];			/* dy matrix */
+guchar s_xform[x][y];			/* intensity scalar matrix */
+guchar scalar;				/* global scalar */
+
+gint i,j;				/* indixes */
+gulong p;				/* pixel value in question */
+guchar u,v,w;				/* modifier variables */
+
+/* clear the new image, we don't want anything getting in the way */
+/* NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD THING, THOUGH */
+memset(new_image,0,x*y);
+
+/* loop through all the lines in the image */
+for (j=0;j<y;j++) {
+  /* loop through all the pixels in the line */
+  for (i=0;i<x;i++) {
+    p = old_image[i][j];
+    u = x_xform[i][j];
+    v = y_xform[i][j];
+    w = s_xform[i][j];
+    new_image[i+u][j+v] = (guchar)((p<<14) / (w * scalar));
+  }
+}
+----- END -----
+
+Note that the above really, *REALLY* sucks performance-wise.  Throw it a
+80x60 image and it'll swamp my poor laptop.  Also note that I simply set
+the pixel value, not merge it.  That means you'd better be sure your
+transform matrix doesn't have overlapping destinations.
+
+Other notes about the above code: x_xform and y_xform are signed chars,
+which means pixels can move in all directions.  The intensity matrix is
+unsigned, with a range from 0 to 255, so is the global scalar.  Note the
+shift of 14bits (2 * 7bits), then divide by each.  That means identity for
+both scalars is at 128.  The FP range of each is thus 0.0 to 2.0.  Very
+handy.

+
+* Pro Audio with GStreamer
+
+This file attempts to document usage of GStreamer for so-called "pro
+audio"[0]. Two audiences are considered: programmers that are
+considering GStreamer for their pro-audio app, and GStreamer developers
+interested in which parts of GStreamer pro-audio uses.
+
+[0] I actually don't like this term, because it's elitist. Of course
+    other audio applications are not inferior, but they are different.
+    I'll stick with the term out of established practice.
+
+** What GStreamer Offers the Pro Audio Developer
+
+Choosing GStreamer for your application gives you lots of things for
+free.
+
+*** A high penetration into POSIX desktops
+
+GStreamer is included with Gnome, so you'll find it already installed on
+an increasing number of desktops. It makes it easier for a user to
+install your app. However, you still have to check for individual
+plugins that you depend on.
+
+*** An extremely flexible signal flow graph
+
+You have elements, connection points, different kinds of processing
+functions, schedulers, etc. You can subclass just about everything, or
+replace whole subsystems as you need to.
+
+All of this you would have to implement somehow. The downside is, of
+course, that it's extremely flexible. The graph isn't run by clock-tick
+-- the delays are carried out by the timekeeping element (if any), when
+execution reaches it. It's cooperative, rather than dictator-style like
+Jack. If all problems have been worked out, etc, it runs smoothly, but
+one poorly coded element can stall the graph.
+
+Restricting graph operation to clock-ticks and using buses instead, like
+SuperCollider 3, would introduce many simplifications to scheduling and
+such, I would think. However, you'd still have to implement your
+signal-flow infrastructure from scratch if you decided to go it alone.
+
+I might revise the above paragraph, though. I like GStreamer's level of
+flexibility a bit too much :)
+
+*** A wide variety of existing plugins
+
+This includes inputs like ALSA, OSS, sndfile, etc, as well as their
+corresponding sinks (outputs). Then there are the network transports.
+And the sound servers (including Jack). LADSPA plugins for free. Some
+DSP things, but admittedly not too much -- this is an area for future
+expansion.
+
+*** Generic plugin behavior
+
+Of course you still have to know some specifics about the plugins you
+use (which properties they have, for example), but in general elements
+of a "pipeline" (signal flow graph -- and no, it doesn't have to look
+like a pipe) are replaceable. Your user can choose between ALSA or OSS
+or even ESD (shudder), and it's simple to implement.
+
+*** Easy threads
+
+Adding threads to your signal flowgraph does takes some thought, but
+once you've decided how to set things up it's reasonably easy.
+Unfortunately realtime threads aren't implemented yet, but that should
+be an easy project, knock on wood.
+
+*** Other Stuff
+
+GStreamer is big these days. I wouldn't say bloated, but there are a lot
+of subsystems relating to "media" that just aren't applicable to
+processing float data. There's a whole system (called "caps") that deals
+with negotiating common formats between elements, when all pro audio has
+to deal with is sample-rate and the number of frames per buffer. There's
+a typefinding and pipeline autoplugging subsystem. There's "tags", like
+from ID3 tags.
+
+You might find uses for these things, and thankfully these uses blur the
+lines between "pro" and "consumer" audio. To an extent, these features
+complicate GStreamer programming. But mostly they stay out of your way
+-- besides caps, they only bother you when you ask them to :-)
+
+** Pro Audio for GStreamer Programmers
+
+Pro audio is a restricted, almost purely mathematical domain. There's
+not that much to worry about. Each channel is separate from the rest
+(never interleaved). All data is in float format, and native byte order.
+The sample rate is typically the same in the whole system. Same with the
+number of frames in a buffer.
+
+So it's simple, but it's different from "normal" audio processing (a
+whole mess of variables to synchronise and convert between, interleaved
+data, codecs, etc). But it's sufficiently different that in the past
+we've had discussions every 8 months or so about why things are
+implemented in such-and-such a way, and why don't we change them, and so
+on. So this part of the document is aimed at GStreamer developer's as a
+kind of documentation for the whole float-caps space.
+
+*** The Format
+
+Pro audio deals with floats. I'm not really worried about doubles --
+although LADSPA carefully #define's LADSPA_Sample so you can override
+it, everything's in float.
+
+There are two variables to be concerned about. One is sample rate, which
+is pretty obvious. The not-so-obvious one is buffer-frames, specifying
+the number of frames that will come in a buffer. If a buffer has fewer
+frames, that indicates EOS is coming on the next pull. This property is
+an optimization to allow easy chaining of buffers in multi-pad elements,
+as well as to prevent deadlocks in circular pipelines, and to comply
+with systems like Jack that operate on clock ticks.
+
+*** Channels
+
+One variable that is not in pro-audio is the number of channels in a
+stream. Streams are always mono. All DSP algorithms expect to receive
+mono data. Multichannel processing is done via multiple inputs. This is
+the complicated part of pro audio for GStreamer, because it means lots
+of multi-pad elements, and complicated pipelines, which is a pain to
+code for (if you're not coding it in Scheme, of course ;). So yes, it's
+kindof a pain, but it is a flexibility that's necessary.
+
+*** Stability
+
+DSP routines written years back still work, because all you need to use
+them is to -lm. GStreamer is a step towards DLL hell. And audio
+developers are a funny bunch. Look at Paul Davis's Ardour CVS, for
+instance. He has a local copy of every library ever coded, ever. No
+joke.
+
+If our platform is to remain attractive to this group, we need to start
+to stabilize the way GStreamer works. Of course API and ABI change,
+we're young. But outside of media-related work, the core is pretty
+stable. When we move to change things after 0.8, changes should be well
+documented.
+
+That's all pretty normal, but there is one special consideration. DSP
+involves lots of custom plugins, maintained outside the GStreamer tree.
+So just because you grep the tree and don't find an instance of X
+function or whatever, it doesn't necessarily mean the feature/behaviour
+is unused. This will be increasingly true for other GStreamer users in
+the future, but it's true now for DSP. I'm talking about me now ;)
+
+OK, enough rambling. Hope this clarifies things a bit.
+
+Andy Wingo, 24 Jan 2004.

+
+Sometimes it's difficult to use GStreamer in real applications where the GUI and
+the GStreamer pipeline are in different threads. You have to somehow make sure
+that the object is not modifying its properties while you get and set them. This
+document is a brief outline of a potential fix to this issue.
+
+* When is it safe to get or set properties?
+
+Well, it is only safe to do so when other threads are not accessing an object.
+So, from the main thread, it is only safe to query or modify properties on an
+object when it is not in the RUNNING state, because when it is RUNNING its
+properties are potentially changing in the thread of execution.
+
+The only place that it is safe to get or set properties while in the RUNNING
+state is from within the thread of execution. Thus, something within the
+iteration loop of the thread must check to see if there are pending property
+changes or queries. There are two places this could be done, from within
+gstthread itself and from within the scheduler. Doing it from gstthread sounds
+like a good idea because it keeps more code out of the scheduler, but is also
+bad in a way because it requires a gstthread-specific api to proxy prop_set and
+prop_get. Setting it in the scheduler sounds good because of its finer
+granularity, but might be bad because it would clutter the scheduler a bit more.
+
+I propose to go with the scheduler-based solution based on system response time
+and out of potentials for integration with gst_clock_wait.
+
+* Implementation
+
+We do want to preserve some measure of generality, however. Considering that
+more threadsafety issues could pop up in the future, it would be nice to have
+one function to call from the scheduler, in the interests of code
+simplification. This function will be present in some elements and not in
+others, and will be modified at run time, so we will make it a function pointer
+within the GstElement struct.
+
+struct _GstElement {
+  ...
+  void (*pre_run_func) (GstElement *);
+  void (*post_run_func) (GstElement *);
+}
+
+Only the managing bin of an element is allowed to set that function, because
+presumably that bin would know something about how to schedule the element.
+Then, in the scheduler, before we call chain functions and before we switch into
+loop functions:
+
+if (element->pre_run_func)
+  element->pre_run_func (element);
+
+Then, to get or set properties, we use the new functions gst_element_get or
+gst_element_set. _set would add the property name and a gvalue onto a queue
+(probably a GAsyncQueue). Then the pre_run_func would go ahead and set the
+properties. _get is a little more tricky; _set doesn't hardly block at all,
+although it's not instantaneous. With _get though, you really don't know what
+the properties are until you query them. The best thing would be to connect to
+the ::notify signal, which executes within the thread of interest. However, say
+you really want to use _get. Hmm. I think that it would have to block. On what?
+Well, probably on an element's mutex. So it seems we might need a
+post_run_func too, to unlock the mutex. We can use the GstObject lock for this.
+
+But we need a little more. How do we know whether or not just calling
+g_object_get/set is ok? I'm thinking this whole prop set/get proxy thing should
+not be abstracted away, that it should be contained in gstelement.c. There are
+more kinds of bins that need threadsafety than just gstthread (I'm thinking
+about jack here). So, we can add on a GAsyncQueue *prop_set_queue; to the
+GstElement struct, and only initialize it in certain managing bins. Then, we can
+set a flag on gstelement, GST_ELEMENT_USE_THREADSAFE_PROPERTIES. If this flag is
+set (by the managing bin), do all this complicated mess; otherwise use the
+gobject native functionality.
+
+So, this is the plan. We'll see how the implementation goes. This should make MT
+gst programming much easier.
+

+
+* Creating Elements Without Factories
+
+** The purpose of factories
+
+On a typical GStreamer system, there are approximately 6.022*10^23
+plugins. GStreamer knows about all of them because of the registry. The
+goal is to avoid initializing each one of them, when maybe for your
+application you only need one or two.
+
+The problem becomes, how do you create an instance of the plugin? The
+normal way to instantiate a class is via g_object_new (TYPE, ARGS...).
+In the case that the plugin isn't loaded, you don't know its type, and
+can't even get it from the type name.
+
+Element factories exist to solve this problem by associating names (like
+"sinesrc" or "identity") with certain types that are provided by the
+plugin. Then when the user asks for "sinesrc", the appropriate plugin is
+loaded, its types are initialized, and then gst_element_factory_create
+creates the object for you.
+
+** Why not factories?
+
+To review, factories (1) allow plugins to remain unloaded if not
+necessary, and (2) make it easy to create elements.
+
+If you are writing an application that has custom elements (as is the
+case with most serious applications), you will probably have the plugin
+loaded up already, and you will have access to the type of the element.
+To muck about creating a plugin for the app, registering the element
+with the plugin, and then creating it with the element factory API
+actually takes more work than the normal way.
+
+** g_object_new
+
+So you want to avoid factories. To create objects with a simple
+g_object_new call is our strategy. However, to preserve the same
+semantics as gst_element_factory_create, we need to know what else is
+needed to initialize a GStreamer element.
+
+The other things that gst_element_factory_create does are as follows:
+
+*** Sets the ->elementfactory member on the element class
+
+Note that anything trying to get the factory won't work (e.g.
+gst_element_get_factory). Thankfully this is less of a problem after the
+0.7 plugin system changes.
+
+*** Initializes the name of the element
+
+To do this ourselves, we either call gst_object_set_name, or when we
+set the "name" property when creating the object.
+
+** Summary
+
+To create a GStreamer element when you know the type, you can just use
+
+g_object_new (get_type_of_my_element (),
+              "name", the_name_you_want_possibly_null,
+              ... any other properties ...
+              NULL);

+This paper will present the GStreamer Media framework. We 
+explain briefly what a media framework is and what its advantages
+are. This introduction presents the basic design of GStreamer
+and how the modularity can provide many benefits when building 
+multimedia applications ranging from simple audio/video players 
+to complex audio/video mixing and non linear editing.
+
+We then go into more detail about the different components of
+the framework and how specific problems were solved.
+State changes are covered first as they bring the pipeline with
+all its components from a sleeping to a running state. The most
+interesting problem here is error recovery and thread interlocking.
+
+We expand on the scheduler that is responsible for making sure all 
+of the components don't step on eachothers toes as they pass along 
+data. We explain one of the possible scheduling methods using
+cothreads and expand on how the number of cothread switches can
+be reduced in order to make the data flow as fast as possible.
+
+Since GStreamer is a very open system that can basically handle
+any media type, a mechanism is provided to negotiate the media
+types between plugins. We continue with an explanation of how
+this type negotiation is done.
+
+Events are the mechanism to indicate changes in the data that is
+flowing through the pipeline, such as End Of Stream notification
+or seek and flush events. We explain how these events work and
+how they interact with the scheduler.
+
+We finally cover some of the interesting libraries that are 
+provided with GStreamer, such as the bytestream library. We 
+explain how all the pieces fit together and how we combine different
+techniques to create a very fast read API.

+Autoplugger V2
+==============
+
+The current autoplugger as described in autoplug1 has some
+serious shortcommings:
+
+ - it is embedded in GstPipeline and cannot be used with a 
+   generic interface. A lot of complexity is inside the 
+   pipeline, more specifically the creation of threads and
+   subbins and the pad connections.
+ - it is not (easily) pluggable.
+
+ 
+
+1) definition
+-------------
+
+We want to define a plugable framework for autoplugging this 
+includes: 
+
+  - autoplugging algorithms can be added and removed at run time.
+  - autoplugging algorithms can be defined by plugins.
+
+The autoplugger is build to handle simple media playback but
+could also be used to create more complex pipelines.
+
+The main focus will be on creating an element (can be a bin)
+that has *one* input pad and *one or more* output pads.
+
+It must be possible for a user app to insert its own elements in
+the autogenerated element.
+
+The autoplugger will be an interface to the low level plugin
+system based on the functional requirements of the user app. 
+the app will for example request an object that can convert
+media type X to media type Y, the user app is not interested in 
+any intermediate steps to accomplish this conversion.
+
+
+2) the API
+----------
+
+The API for the user apps should be no more then this:
+
+  GstElement* gst_autoplug_caps_list (GstAutoplug *autoplug, 
+                                      GList *incaps, 
+			              GList *outcaps, ...);
+
+  autoplug is a reference to the autoplug implementation
+  incaps is a GList of GstCaps* for the source pad, the last set
+  of arguments is a va_list of destination caps lists.
+
+A handle to the autoplugger implementation can be obtained 
+with
+
+  GList* gst_autoplugfactory_get_list (void);
+  
+which will return a GList* of autopluggers.
+
+  GstAutoplug* gst_autoplugfactory_make ("name");
+  
+or
+
+  GstAutoplug* gst_autoplugfactory_create (GstAutoplugFactory *autoplug);
+
+is used to get an autoplugger.
+
+
+3) the plugins API
+------------------
+
+plugins can add their own autoplugger implementation by
+subclassing an abstract autoplugger class and implementing/
+overriding various methods.
+
+the autoplugger can be registered with:
+
+  gst_plugin_add_autoplugger (GstPlugin *plugin,
+                              GstAutoplugFactory *autoplug);
+
+This will allow us to only load the autoplugger when needed.
+
+
+
+4) implementation
+-----------------
+
+We will implement two autopluggers:
+
+ - a static autoplugger. This autoplugger recursively adds
+   elements to the target element until all of the possible
+   pads are connected to something. The static autoplugger
+   only operates on padtemplates and ALWAYS pads. The pipeline
+   is not started before all elements are connected, hence 
+   the 'static' autoplugger. This autoplugger will be a rework
+   of the current autoplugger.
+
+ - a dynamic autoplugger. This autoplugger configures the 
+   pipeline at runtime based on the pad capabilities when they
+   become available. this allows for more fine grained 
+   autoplugging than can be achieved with the static one because
+   it can be based on the actual media stream you are handling.
+
+the autopluggers will be implemented in their separate plugins, 
+outside of the core libraries and are therefore optional.
+
+
+5) the autoplugger object
+-------------------------
+
+the autoplugger object will be an abstract class with the following
+properties:
+
+ - name, description, more text to identify the autoplugger.
+
+ - a class method autoplug_caps_list that has to be implemented by
+   the real autoplugger.
+
+optionally, the core autoplugger code can provide convenience 
+functions to implement custom autopluggers. The shortest path
+algorithm with pluggable weighting and list functions come to 
+mind.
+
+signals will be added to the autoplugger so that user apps can
+modify the constructed pipeline by adding extra objects. 
+A possible use case would be to let gstmediaplay perform an 
+autoplug on the media stream and insert a custom sound/video
+effect in the pipeline when an appropriate element is created.
+
+the "new_object" signal will be fired by the autoplugger whenever
+a new object has been created. This signal can be caught by the
+user app to perform an introspection on the newly created object.
+

+The autoplugger is a custom bin with a set of custom add/remove methods.
+The point is to virtually add a set of plugins that should take part in
+the autoplugging (like the src, sink elements). The autoplugger should 
+try hard to included these plugins in the final pipeline.
+
+The autoplugger has to be a bin because else we cannot put it into the
+paused state when dynamically connecting elements.
+
+We cannot include the intermediate elements or sink/src elements to the bin
+right away because else they will be scheduled by the scheduler.
+
+The bin will use the elementfactory klass field to get a basic idea about 
+the plugin:
+
+ - the 'Source' keyword is used to detect source elements
+ - the 'Sink' keyword is used to detect the sink elements or targets
+   of the autoplugging.
+ - other elements are considered intermediate elements and will be 
+   inserted when possible.
+
+
+algorithm:
+
+- Autoplugging starts from a source element, it will be added to the real bin.
+- for all unconnected pads:
+  - if pad has NULL padtemplate caps add typefind + autoplugcache to the pad
+- if unconnected pad has fixed caps, find element in repository that can
+  connect.
+  - first check elements added to the bin
+  - test elements ordered by rank
+  - favour 'Demux' type elements close to sources, 'Decoder' elements after
+    that and 'Filter' elements close to sinks. 
+- link dummy element with pads with non-fixed caps. The dummy element getcaps
+  function will use the repository to return a list of compatible caps, so that
+  the element can choose freely. The dummy element is replaced with a real 
+  element when caps become fixed.
+- all new_pad signals and caps notifications trigger the above actions.

+the current capsnegotiation sucks and plainly doesn't work for queues.
+one of the reasons is that the core is trying to do too much, like
+being a mediator in the negotiation process. There is also way too much
+interaction between plugins. Plugins have to keep a lot of state too.
+
+The proposed method works by sending chains of caps instead, requiring 
+a worst case of 2 interactions between plugins. The drawback is that
+a negotiating plugin has to do a bit more work, but in pactice this is
+not a real argument against the proposed method, as the actions it has
+to perform cannot be avoided. We will provide sufficient APIs to 
+facilitate this.
+
+We are not going to send random chains of caps between plugins but we
+are going to filter them by using a new gst_caps_intersect() function
+that can find the common media types and properties between the plugins.
+The main idea is that the simple case should remain simple.

+purpose
+-------
+
+GStreamer has a very flexible mechanism to describe media types using
+mime types and key/value pairs (GstCaps). The definition of media types 
+is entirely done by the plugins which can set the media type to one or 
+more of the plugins GstPads. 
+
+Pads with the same mime type and 'compatible' properties are allowed to
+connect. It is possible that a pad can accept or produce many different 
+media types.
+
+The purpose of caps negotiation is to provide a framework for plugins so
+that they can agree on a common media type for their pads.
+
+
+Capabilities (GstCaps)
+----------------------
+
+The core component in the caps negotiation system are GstCaps. They consist
+of:
+
+ - a name (ex. "my_audio_capabilities") 
+ - a mime-type (ex. audio/raw, audio/mp3, ...)
+ - a list of key/value pairs (ex. channels=2, rate=44100, ...)
+
+The list of key/value pairs is maintained by the GstProps object.
+
+The GstProps object maintains a GList of GstPropsEntries. An entry has
+a key, which is always a string constant (internally converted to a GQuark)
+and a value, which can be one of the following:
+
+ - an integer constant (ex. 5)
+ - a float contant (ex. 1.0)
+ - a string constant (ex. "int")
+ - a boolean constant (ex. FALSE)
+ - a fourcc constant (ex. I420) 
+     * fourcc codes are usually used to describe a video format
+
+In addition to these constant values, the following variable values are
+supported too:
+
+ - an integer range (ex. 0-200)
+ - a float range (ex. 1.0-3.0)
+ - a list of values (ex. 1, 2, 5). 
+     * A List cannot contain another list and the
+       entries in the list should all have the
+       same type (int, float, string, fourcc). It is
+       allowed to mix integers/floats and  
+       integer/float ranges in a list.
+
+A capability is usually described as follows:
+
+                                GST_CAPS_NEW (
+      capability name --->        "my_audio_capabilities",
+      mime-type --------->        "audio/raw",
+                          (        "format",	GST_PROPS_STRING ("int"),
+      GstProps ---------> (        "channels",	GST_PROPS_INT_RANGE (1, 2),
+       (list of entries)  (        "rate",	GST_PROPS_INT (44100)
+                                )
+
+				(-----------)   (--------------------------)
+                                  entry key         entry value
+
+Two capabilities can be chained together to form a larger capability:
+
+                              (  GST_CAPS_NEW (
+                              (    "my_mp3_capability",
+	                      (    "audio/mp3",
+	one capability ---->  (    NULL    
+        created by chaining   (  ),
+        two capabilities.     (  GST_CAPS_NEW (
+                              (    "my_vorbis_capability",
+	                      (    "audio/vorbis",
+	                      (    NULL
+                              (  )
+
+Capabilities always work as constraints, this means that they constrain the
+media type to the given mime-type and properties. By this definition a NULL 
+GstCaps or a NULL GstProps means: no constraints.
+
+
+Variable capabilities vs. fixed capabilities
+--------------------------------------------
+
+Definition:
+
+  A GstProps structure is said to be fixed if it doesn't contain lists or
+  ranges, otherwise it is a variable GstProps. A variable GstProps, by definitin
+  does not constrain the media type to a set of fixed properties.
+
+  A GstCaps is said to be fixed if it is not chained and it doesn't contain
+  a variable GstProps component.
+
+

+
+
+GstCaps usage
+-------------
+
+GstCaps are used in the following data structures:
+
+ - padtemplates. 
+    * padtemplates are added to elementfactory to describe the possible
+      pads that an element created from said factory can have.
+    * padtemplates contain the name, direction and presence of the pads.
+    * padtemplates also describe the media types that this element can
+      accept/produce using GstCaps.
+    * padtemplates can provide fixed or variable GstCaps for the pads.
+    * padtemplates can be used by the element to create its pads and is
+      highly recommended.
+    * the padtemplate GstCaps are saved into the registry so that the
+      media types an element can operate on, are known without having to
+      bring the element into memory.
+      
+ - pad caps
+    * pad caps are _fixed_ caps attached to a pad to describe the exact media
+      type this pad is handling. A pad with caps is said to be a "tainted" pad.
+      
+ - connection filters
+    * a connection filter is created when two pads are connected. It describes 
+      the media type(s) that _can_ flow through this connection. 
+
+ - application connection filters
+    * When the application connects two pads, it can specify an application
+      connection filter that will act as additional constraints on the media types
+      that can flow through the connection.
+
+Connection filters and application filters are cleared when two connected pads 
+are disconnected. Pad caps are not cleared.  Padtemplates are immutable and 
+never cleared.
+
+
+The GstPad get_caps function
+----------------------------
+
+the gst_pad_get_caps function returns the caps of a given pad. The pad caps are
+calculated as:
+
+ - if the pad has pad caps, return those
+ - else if the pad has a getcaps function, call the function and return the result
+ - else if the pad has a padtemplate, return the padtemplate caps
+ - else return NULL
+
+
+Purpose of caps negotiation
+---------------------------
+
+The purpose of the caps negotiation procedure is to set "pad caps" on a pad
+so that it is compatible with the "connection filter". This has to be done 
+_before_ any data passing happens through the connection.  Data passing between two 
+pads is _not_ allowed when the pad caps are not compatible with the connection 
+filter or when the pad caps of two pads participating in the connection are not
+equal.
+
+Real caps negotiation starts as soon as an element is in the READY state or higher.
+This means that the connect functions of the pads are only called when the element
+is at least READY. The intersection between two pads is made at connect time, 
+regardless of element state.
+
+
+GstPad connection
+-----------------
+
+When two pads are connected get_caps is called on both pads to get their caps.
+Then the intersection between those caps is made, this will give us all the
+possible media types that can flow through this pad connection. Optionally the
+application can provide additional caps, the pad intersection is also made with
+the application caps. 
+
+The intersection and the optional application caps are stored in the two pads.
+
+If the intersection is NULL, the two pads have no common types and the connection
+is refused.
+
+If the intersection is a fixed caps, this means there is only one possible media type
+that can be used for this connection.
+
+For all not NULL intersections the pad connect functions are called with the 
+intersection. Depending on the result of the connect funtion the connection is
+allowed or refused.
+
+If the intersection is fixed and the pad connect functions agreed to the caps, 
+the caps are set on the pads.
+
+Note that pad caps are never set for non fixed caps.
+
+!Example 1:
+! 
+! 1. before connecting the pads, they both have a set of possible media types,
+!    on the pad, through the getcaps function or on the padtemplate (here
+!    represented with capital letters)
+!
+!    srcpad                       sinkpad
+!       A                           B
+!       B                           F
+!       C                           A
+!	                            G
+!
+! 2. when performing the connection, the intersection between the two sets of caps
+!    is made.
+!    
+!    srcpad                       sinkpad
+!       A )                      (  B
+!       B )-------->  A   <------(  F
+!       C )           B          (  A
+! 	                         (  G
+! 
+! 3. In this case the intersection is not a fixed caps (it's a chained caps).
+!    the connect function of the two pads are called (if any), the connect
+!    function can accept of refuse the caps.
+! 
+! 4. if the caps are accepted, the intersection caps are set on both pads.
+! 
+! 5. plugins will typically not configure themselves if they get variable caps.
+!    It is possible though for a plugin to select one of the caps, fixate
+!    some properties and refine the filter to fixed caps (see later)
+!
+
+
+!Example 2:
+! 
+! 1. we take two pads that intersect to fixed caps (B):
+! 
+!    srcpad                       sinkpad
+!       A  )                     (  B
+!       B  )------->  B  <-------(  F
+! 
+! 2. both pad connect functions are called. 
+! 
+! 3. assuming the connect functions did not refuse the connection, the caps
+!    are set on both pads (because they are fixed).
+! 
+!    srcpad  (B)--------------(B) sinkpad
+!       A                           B
+!       B                           F
+! 
+   
+!Example 3:
+! 
+! 1. we take two pads, one with pad caps, another one with a padtemplate. 
+! 
+!    srcpad (B)                   sinkpad
+!            !                   (  B
+!            ------>  B  <-------(  F
+! 
+! 2. the pad get_caps function will return the pad caps of the srcpad and
+!    the padtemplate caps of the sinkpad. The intersection is made, yielding
+!    a fixed caps (B) which is sent to both connect functions (if any)
+!
+! 3. If the connect function(s) didn't refuse the connection the fixed caps
+!    are set on both pads. The intersection is also kept in the pad object.
+!
+!    srcpad  (B)--------------(B) sinkpad
+!                                   B
+!                                   F
+!
+! 4. when fixed caps are received on the sinkpad the plugin will typically 
+!    configure itself to deal with the format.
+!
+
+
+Pad connect functions
+---------------------
+
+A Pad can be notified when another pad is connected or reconnected to it with
+fixed or variable caps. This notification will be done with the optional 
+GstPadConnectFunction callback that an element can provide for a pad.
+Remember that this connection is _always_ called, not only whith fixed caps
+but also with variable caps (if any).
+
+We will explain some of the common situations with some examples.
+
+!Example 4:
+!
+! 1. We have a simple mpeg audio decoder connected to a simple audio sink.
+!    The mpeg decoder doesn't have a connect function on

+------------------------

+
+perform negotiation strictly left to right. At some point during
+iterate, mad will know the caps of the media stream and will need
+to inform osssink of this before pushing out a buffer.
+mad only has one set of fixed caps.
+
+1) try_set_caps
+
+ mad does a try_set_caps with the caps if all goes well, osssink
+ accepts and negotiation succeeds.
+
+ if the try_set_caps function fails, the application should have 
+ a change to recover.
+ 
+ - mad therefore calls gst_pad_caps_error_try_recover, this will
+   emit a signal on the pad that the app can catch. One of the
+   signal arguments will contain a list of possible caps.
+
+ - the app can use the allowed caps to find another element that
+   is compatible with the caps and the peer element caps.
+
+ - the app will connect the new element with mad, negotiation
+   will happen again, the link will fail or succeed, if it fails,
+   thr app knows because the link function returns FALSE.
+
+ - if the link succeeds, pad caps are set and the try_recover 
+   function returns TRUE, mad then knows the issue was resolved
+   and can continue. It will have received the final caps in its
+   srclink function.
+
+ - if no signal handler is connected to the caps_nego_failure signal
+   the issue will remain unresolved and a big debug warning is
+   printed on the console to debug the issue. mad will get a
+   return value of FALSE and may stop.

+OUTDATED
+--------
+
+
+caps negotiation
+================
+
+1) purpose
+----------
+
+The pads expose the media types they can handle using a mime
+type and a set of properties. Before the pad is created or
+used to pass buffers, we only know the global 'range' of media
+data this pad can accept. When the element has had a chance to
+look at the media data, only then it knows the exact values of the 
+properties.
+
+example1:
+!
+! The mp3 decoder exposes the capabilities of its src pad
+! with the following caps:
+!
+!     'mpg123_src':
+!       MIME type: 'audio/raw':
+!       format: Integer: 16
+!       depth: Integer: 16
+!       rate: Integer range: 11025 - 48000
+!       channels: Integer range: 1 - 2
+
+as you can see in example1, the padtemplate has both a range
+(for the audio rate) and a list (for the number of channels)
+for its properties.
+
+only when the mpg123 element has decoded the first mpeg audio
+header, it knows the exact values of the rate and channels
+properties.
+
+suppose that we want to connect this src pad to the sink pad
+of an audiosink with the properties given in example2:
+
+example2:
+!
+!     'audiosink_sink':
+!       MIME type: 'audio/raw':
+!       format: Integer: 16
+!       depth: List:
+!         Integer: 8
+!         Integer: 16
+!       rate: Integer range: 8000 - 44000
+!       channels: Integer range: 1 - 2
+
+we can see that connecting the mpg123 src pad with the
+audiosinks sink pad can cause a potential problem with the
+rate property.
+
+When the mpg123 decoder decides to output raw audio with a
+48000Hz samplerate, the audiosink will not be able to handle
+it. The conservative approach would be to disallow the connection
+between the two incompatible pads. This rules out any potential
+problems but severely limits the amount of possible connections
+between the elements. 
+
+Another approach would be to allow the connection (and mark it
+as dangerous) and let the two elements figure out a suitable
+media type at runtime. This procedure is called caps negotiation.
+
+
+2) a bit of history
+-------------------
+
+The typing of the data that was attached to a buffer used to be
+done using GstMeta* (and it still is as of 11 feb 2001). With
+the new GstCaps and GstProps system this typing is gradually moved
+to the pads and to the padtemplates. This has several advantages:
+
+  - the typing of the data tends to be static. The type of media
+    doesn't change for every buffer.
+
+  - Moving the typing up to the pad(templates) allows us to save
+    them into the registry and allows us to figure out what pads
+    are compatible.
+
+  - the current metadata implementation needs header files. this may
+    change when we also use properties for metadata.
+
+example3:
+!
+! This is the current GstMeta structure that travels with audio buffers
+!
+!  struct _MetaAudioRaw {
+!    GstMeta meta;
+!
+!    /* formatting information */
+!    gint format;
+!    gint channels;
+!    gint frequency;
+!    gint bps;
+!  };
+	    
+
+The question still remains what purpose the metadata will serve
+now that we expose the media type in the pads. Some possibilities:
+
+  - interesting information, not describing the data itself but the
+    context in which the data was generated (suggested buffer size,
+    timestamps, etc...)
+
+  - user app metadata. 
+
+In this proposal we also assume that the current use of metadata using
+GstMeta is deprecated and that we move this information to the properties
+of the pads.
+
+
+3) the pad/padtemplates caps
+----------------------------
+
+All elements have to provide a padtemplate for their pads.
+
+The padtemplates provide a range of possible media types this pad can
+src/sink. the main purpose for the padtemplates is to allow a
+rough guess at which pads are compatible before even a single buffer
+has been processed by the element.
+
+pads are usually created from the templates. When the pad is created
+it has no GstCaps* attached to it yet. The possible caps this pad
+can have is exposed in the padtemplate. The caps are filled in by
+the element when it knows the values for the caps.
+
+
+4) the connect function
+-----------------------
+
+when two pads are connected the following steps will take
+place (not sure, FIXME): 
+
+ - if both pads have caps, the caps are checked. If the caps
+   are incompatible, the padtemplates are checked, if they
+   are compatible, caps negotiation is performed.
+
+ - if one of the pads has caps, the caps is checked against
+   the padtemplate of the peer pad. If they are incompatible,
+   the padtemplates are compared, if they are incompatible,
+   caps negotiation is performed.
+   
+ - if none of the pads have caps, the padtemplates are checked, 
+   if they are incompatible, a warning is issued.
+   
+
+5) when the element knows the media type it is handling
+-------------------------------------------------------
+
+When the element has received its first buffer it will know
+the media type it is handling by inspecting the buffer.
+
+before pushing the data out to its peer element(s), the element
+will set its src pad with the appropriate caps and properties.
+These caps must follow the following rules:
+
+  - the caps must be compatible with the padtemplates of this 
+    pad.
+
+  - the caps cannot contain ranges or lists.
+
+when the element wants to change the caps of a pad, it has to 
+perform gst_pad_renegotiate (GstPad *pad). this will trigger
+the caps negotiation procedure.
+
+this will trigger the class method of the pad and calls the pads
+gst_pad_negotiate function:
+
+  GstCaps *gst_pad_negotiate (GstPad *pad, GstCaps *caps, guint count);
+
+This function takes a GstCaps *structure as an argument (typically the
+current caps of the pad) and a negotiation counter. this counter can be
+used to keep track of the negotiation process.
+
+The pad then creates a new caps structure with the desired caps.
+If the caps are accepted, it just returns the provided input caps. the
+_renegotiate function will set the caps of both pads whenever the
+input caps are the same (pointer wise) as the input caps.
+
+the caps structure is checked against the padtemplate of the peer pad,
+if it is incompatible the gst_pad_negotiate function is called again
+and the element is supposed to create another caps structure.
+
+the gst_pad_renegotiate function then calls the gst_pad_negotiate
+function of the peer pad with the new caps as the argument. The peer
+pad can adjust or create a new caps if it doesn't accept it. 
+
+the caps structure keeps on bouncing between the two pads until one
+of the pads negotiation functions returns the caps unmodified. 
+
+The element can also return a NULL pointer if it has run out of
+options for the caps structure. When this happens, both pads are set
+the the NULL caps again and the pad connnection is broken.
+
+The negotiation process is stopped after a fixed number of tries,
+when the counter has reached some limit. This limit is typically
+checked by the pads negotiate function.
+
+
+6) caps negotiation function
+----------------------------
+
+the negotiate function of a pad is called whenever the pad or
+peer pad has performed _renegotiate.
+
+example5:
+!
+! this is the caps negotiation function implemented by an element on
+! one of its sink pads.
+!
+!  static GstCaps*
+!  gst_pad_negotiate (GstPad *pad, GstCaps *caps, guint counter)
+!  {
+!    /* we don't accept anything else than audio/raw */
+!    if (strcmp (gst_caps_get_mime (caps), "audio/raw"))
+!      return NULL;
+!
+!    if (gst_caps_get_int_prop (caps, "format") != AFMT_S16_LE)
+!      return NULL;
+!      
+!    /* we accept everything else */
+!    return caps;
+!  }
+
+When the negotiate function returns NULL (it does not accept the
+specified caps of the peer pad), the negotiation process is stopped.
+
+
+
+APPENDIX A: use cases
+=====================
+
+1) mpg123 src!sink audiosink
+----------------------------
+
+When the pads are connected the padtemplates are checked and it 
+turns out that the pads might be incompatible (mpg123 can do
+48000Hz while audiosink can do 44000Hz). Nothing happens at 
+connect time except for the user app that can mark this connection
+as possibly dangerous and keep some spare elements ready for when 
+the pads turn out to be incompatible.
+
+both elements start out with no caps at all (NULL). mpg123 wants
+to output a buffer with specific properties. It calls 
+gst_pad_renegotiate (mpg123->srcpad). 
+
+The _renegotiate functions calls the negotiate function of the
+mpg123->srcpad. the negotiate function would look like this:
+
+
+/*
+ * The mpg123 element cannot convert the decoded type into something
+ * else so it has to force the caps of the src pad into the specific
+ * type as defined by the mp3.
+ */
+static GstCaps*

+{

+
+  mpg123 = GST_MPG123 (gst_pad_get_parent (pad));
+
+  /* we got caps in, check them */
+  if (caps != NULL) {
+    if (!strcmp (gst_caps_get_mime (caps), "audio/raw") &&
+        (gst_caps_get_int_prop (caps, "format") == AFMT_S16_LE) &&
+        (gst_caps_get_int_prop (caps, "depth") == 16) &&
+        (gst_caps_get_int_prop (caps, "rate") == mpg123->rate) &&
+        (gst_caps_get_int_prop (caps, "channels") == mpg123->channels)) {
+      return caps;
+    }
+  }
+  /* we didn't get caps, so we decide */
+  else if (counter != 2) {

+  return NULL;

+
+
+The audiosink pad negotiate function would look like this:

+/*
+ * The audiosink has a wide range of possible parameters for
+ * its sink pad, based on the audio card capabilities and 
+ * possibly the element configuration.
+ * we assume the audiosink element can be both the initiator of 
+ * the negotiations and the negotiated one.
+ */

+{
+  GstAudiosink *audiosink;

+purpose
+-------
+
+A proposal for proper syncing and clocking of a pipeline.
+
+Requirements
+------------
+
+ - elements should be able to get the time and wait for a specific
+   time
+ - some elements should be able to control and adjust the clock.
+   (clock master)
+ - the application should be able to provide another clock.
+
+Clocks
+------
+
+A clock extends the abstract GstClock class.
+
+gst_clock_get_time should always report an equal or increasing
+value with each succesive call.
+
+
+
+Clock providers
+---------------
+
+Clock providers call gst_element_provides_clock (element, clock)
+in their _init function. This will set some element flags.
+This also means that a clock provider cannot stop being a clock
+provider.
+
+Clock providers will update the clock at specific intervals. 
+get_resolution/set_resolution can be used to control the resolution.
+
+When a clock provider is not going to update the clock anymore
+it should make sure elements still blocked on the clock get
+unblocked at the right time. This can be done by converting all
+blocking waits to a select call. All further waits on the clock
+should be estimated (using gettimeofday for example)
+
+
+Clock receivers
+---------------
+
+An element needing a clock must implement the element receive_clock method.
+It has to use the clock received in this function or if the 
+clock == NULL it should not do any waiting at all.
+
+
+Clocks and the scheduler
+------------------------
+
+The scheduler knows about the clocks, else a clock provider and receiver
+in the same scheduler could cause a deadlock.
+
+Only one clock provider is allowed per scheduler. multiple clock
+receivers are allowed per scheduler.
+
+
+
+Specifying clocks
+-----------------
+
+on every bin with a scheduler, gst_bin_use_clock (bin, clock) can be used 
+to force the use of this specific clock for all the elements in this bin. 
+
+gst_bin_use_clock (bin, NULL) to disable all clocking for this bin.
+
+gst_bin_auto_clock (bin) to use the default algorithm to find a clock.
+
+bins that get a use clock set a flag and store the clock, they also call
+set_clock on all of their children. When other children are added, they
+all get the stored clock.
+
+
+Clock distribution
+------------------
+
+clock providers and receivers are collected in the bins on element 
+add/remove, recursing bins if needed. 
+
+the toplevel bin with a scheduler selects the global clock and calls
+set_clock on itself. This happens in the NULL->READY state.
+
+bins dispatch the set_clock to to all of the reveivers. Bins with
+a scheduler and another use_clock do nothing.
+
+Bins with a scheduler also notify the scheduler of the clock.
+
+
+Clock usage
+-----------
+
+when an element wants to wait for a specific time, if calls
+gst_element_clock_wait (elements, clock, time). The call is dispatched
+to the scheduler of the element which can use the owner field 
+of the clock to check if the elements are in the same scheduler.
+
+For elements waiting for a clock provided by an element in another
+scheduler there is no problem.
+
+When provider and receiver are in the same scheduler, a deadlock can
+occur since the scheduler will block on the wait without being able to
+schedule the provider again to update the clock. 
+
+A solution would be to call the async notify of the clock and schedule
+some other element (the provider?). We probably need an event based
+scheduler for this. When the async event arrives we can reschedule
+the receiver and continue.
+
+The current scheduler will assert on this condition for now.
+
+
+Changing clocks
+---------------
+
+The clock can only be changed when the bin is in the PAUSED state.
+
+
+State Changes
+-------------
+
+When the pipeline is PAUSED, the clock is stopped with 
+gst_clock_enable (clock, FALSE). The clock should unblock all
+waiting elements ASAP and return GST_CLOCK_STOP in the wait.
+
+Elements waiting for a clock and receiving the STOP should 
+process the last buffer ASAP and break out of their loop.
+
+When the pipeline is brought to the READY state, the clock is 
+set to 0.
+
+When the clock is enabled again, it should start counting from where
+it was last disabled.
+
+NULL->READY     : distribute clock, clock_reset, 
+READY->PAUSED   : clock_activate (FALSE)
+PAUSED->PLAYING : clock_activate (TRUE)
+PLAYING->PAUSED : clock_activate (FALSE);
+PAUSED->READY   : clock_reset
+READY->NULL     : delete clock;
+
+
+automatic Clock selection
+-------------------------
+
+Select a random clock from the Src elements.
+if no Src elements exist with a clock, select a random clock from the
+Sink elements.
+else use a default System Clock.
+
+Src elements with a clock are prefered because they usualy provide
+live audio/video.
+
+Issues
+------
+
+ossrc ! osssink can cause clock drift if osssink doesn't process the bytes
+at the same rate osssrc provides them (different hardware). Things will
+stutter and cracle if this is the case.	QoS and a resampler could solve
+this.
+
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+                     -- queue ! mpeg2dec ! videosink
+                    /
+filesrc ! mpegdemux 
+                    \
+                     -- queue ! mad ! osssink
+
+
+videosink is a receiver
+osssink is a provider
+
+osssink is selected as a clock provider since it is a Sink. The global
+pipeline distributes the clock to videosink and osssink.
+osssink sees that it receives its own clock.
+
+osssink uses the OSS ioctls to determine the number of bytes processed
+by the hardware. using the audio rate it can figure out the exact time
+and updates its clock with a resolution that matches the resolution 
+as closely as possible. 
+
+videosink blocks on the clock. with each update of the clock videosink
+is unblocked if the current time >= wait time and shows the frame.
+
+when osssink is PAUSED, the clock will not be updated anymore. osssink
+instructs its clock to convert all requests to select() calls.
+When it is set to PLAYING again, it resumes normal operation.

+CORBA and bonobo ramblings
+==========================
+
+This is about something I know nothing about, so I want
+your views on the subject :)
+
+statements in this doc might contain plain nonsense and 
+utter ignorance about the subject, so feel free to correct
+no matter how many brown paper bags I need to put over my
+head.
+
+
+CORBA
+-----
+
+The object request broker. It basically allows you to declare
+objects using a language called IDL. It has the nice benefit
+of allowing objects to live in other contexts, languages and 
+even on other machines over the network.
+
+Wrapping the GStreamer objects in CORBA objects doesn't look
+like a problem. It will immediatly allow us to create objects
+accros the network and use the framework in a distributed
+environment.
+
+You will end up with a lot of corba objects using this method.
+Is this the way to do it? do we only need to CORBA-ify some
+of the core objects instead?
+
+I see a CORBA wrapper as something that exposes the API of
+GStreamer. If I want to do distributed media processing I would
+build up an app with corba calls. The point is that you use
+the lowlevel CORBA API to create a distributed media app.
+
+
+Bonobo
+------
+
+A component model build with CORBA. Bonobo has provisions for
+creating embedable objects. As I understand it, this means that
+it has something visible to embed. I know you can also use 
+Bonobo without the GUI parts but why would we prefer Bonobo
+over CORBA to handle that? 
+
+Bonobo has a framework to create toolbars, menus and other 
+neat stuff. It also has a serialisation mechanism that allows
+you to, for example, merge a pipeline with a document in one
+single stream. 
+
+I see bonobo as a high level service provider, you create a
+mediaplayer component that can be embeded into a document and
+stuff like that.  The point here is that you use bonobo to 
+create services out of user apps build with GStreamer.

+
+EOS as implemented on Jan 21 2001:
+
+1) terminology
+--------------
+
+EOS: end of stream. The problem we are trying to solve here is 
+     detecting when the processing of a piece of media data has
+     ended. 
+
+     This problem can get complicated because the pipeline might
+     contain an arbitrary number of threads and other ASYNC and
+     DECOUPLED elements like queues. We are trying to solve the
+     obvious cases first by making some assumptions (see limitations)
+     in order to avoid the exponentially growing complexity.
+
+     The trick is to detect when all the elements/subbins/threads
+     and done processing their data. This involves monitoring the
+     threads and elements.
+
+     Catching the EOS signals from an element is easy. We are focusing
+     here on the EOS signal propagation to the manager bin up to the
+     toplevel bin.
+
+EOS call: the pads have a method gst_pad_set_eos () that will
+     be called by an element that cannot send any more data on the
+     pad. 
+
+EOS signals: elements fires the EOS signal when all it's pads are in
+    EOS.
+
+chains: at plan generation, the bin will find the elements it has to
+    manage. The elements that are managed together are called a chain.
+    This is typically a set of elements that need input from their
+    peer element before they can output data. When one of those elements
+    cannot provide more data and goes into EOS, the other elements
+    are basically worthless and there is no point in trying to schedule
+    them anymore.
+
+    Chains are typically broken up on DECOUPLED elements. Those elements
+    have no clear relation between their input/output behaviour, like
+    the queue.
+
+EOS denial: An element can deny an EOS call by returning FALSE on the
+    overridden EOS call. This behaviour is typical for an element that 
+    performs _get_region on its sinkpad and basically does not care
+    about the EOS because it knows it will pull a specific region
+    anyway.
+    
+
+2) EOS implementation
+---------------------
+
+EOS is currently implemented by selectively disabling scheduling of
+the chains. This procedure continues untill a bin/thread has no more
+chains left to schedule, at which point it will fire the EOS signal.
+
+A gboolean was added to the chain structure to indicate if this chain
+need scheduling. Initially this will gboolean will be set to TRUE.
+
+the gst_bin_iterate_func will only schedule those chains that have 
+their need_scheduling flag to TRUE. 
+
+All elements are treated as potential EOS signal providers. When we add
+the elements to a chain, we attach the eos signal to them and hand
+the chain they were added to as an argument to the signal handler.
+When an element goes to EOS, we mark the chain as need_scheduling=FALSE.
+This removes the chain from the scheduling loop.
+
+Since plain bins in bins are flattened during the chain creation, we do 
+not need to worry about the bin EOS. 
+
+Other elements that do their own managing (like threads) are treated
+differently, they are added to a list of EOS-providers. Since they
+have their own chains and use the same iterate_func, they will eventually
+fire EOS on their own when they run out of schedulable chains. 
+The EOS signal of the EOS providers is caught by the parent bin which 
+will then remove the bin from the list of possible EOS providers.
+
+Combining the EOS providers list and the chains, the bin will fire
+and EOS signal when 1) it has no more chains to schedule, 2) all its
+EOS providers have signaled EOS.
+
+3) queue EOS handling
+---------------------
+
+The queue overrides the eos call and performs the following:
+
+Set the sinkpad to EOS and signal its internal g_cond to unlock any
+waiting threads on the srcpad.
+
+The scrpad _get function performs the EOS call when no more buffers
+are queued and the sinkpad is in EOS. This causes the EOS call to
+propagate downstream and effectively causes all chains and threads
+to become EOS.
+
+
+4) limitations
+--------------
+
+We assume a chain is a single schedualable entity. Rescheduling of
+the bins and chains are not performed. 
+
+No provisions for changing the state of the elements in EOS, although 
+this probably isn't hard to do.
+
+No provisions for undoing the EOS state. This is probably related to
+the state change, where a chain should become schedulable again when the
+element goes back to the PLAYING state.

+This is a round up from our IRC session on events. It's open for
+discussion of course.
+
+Definition 
+----------
+
+The event system is designed to be a mechanism for _inter_plugin_
+communication. Their scope is therefore limited in a way that they do
+not serve as a way to communicate between plugins and the app (signals
+and properties are still used for plugin-app communication).
+
+Events will be generated by either a plugin or the app. It should be
+possible for a plugin to generate an event on one of its pads and it
+should be possible for an app to insert an event on an abitrary pad in
+the pipeline.
+
+
+Event handling 
+--------------
+
+Events can both travel upstream or downstream. Some events, by nature,
+only travel in one direction.
+
+* downstream events
+
+  - Travel in the same way buffers do. This includes that they are handled
+    by the scheduler. The rationale is that the events should be kept
+    as close to the buffers are possible.
+
+  - plugins should check the type of the GstData passed in the _chain
+    or _loop function and act appropriatly. This can be done by either 
+    doing their own stuff or by calling the default handler.
+
+  - are handled on the sink pad.
+
+* upstream events
+
+  - are handled with an event handler attached to the srcpad. A default
+    handler will be implemented for pads that don't implement their own 
+    handler.
+
+  - travel as fast as possible. the rationale is that a seek event should
+    get to the src element ASAP.
+
+
+Possible candidates for events 
+------------------------------
+
+  - QoS
+   quality of service. Plugins can notify other plugins about the quality
+   of the pipeline. A video element can for example say that it receives
+   too much frames and that plugins connected to it need to slow down.
+
+  - EOS
+   A plugin can notify other plugins that it has run out-of-data.
+
+  - Seek
+   Used to notify plugins that they need to seek to a certain byte offset
+   or timestamp.
+
+  - discontinuous
+   A plugin has detected a discontinuity in the stream. Other plugins
+   might need to resync.
+
+  - flush
+   Plugins need to get rid of any buffered data ASAP.
+
+  - caps nego??  
+  - bufferpool get??  
+  - ...
+
+
+application generated events 
+----------------------------
+
+The application can insert events into the pipeline at arbirary
+places. This will be done by calling gst_pad_event() on a pad.
+
+A first implementation will only cover inserting events on src pads
+since inserting events on sinkpads needs changes to the scheduler.
+
+
+Effects of events on plugins 
+----------------------------
+
+some events are going to change the state of an element. The EOS event
+will for example change the state of an element to the PAUSED state. Not
+sure when or how this will happen.
+
+
+use cases 
+---------
+
+1) filesrc ! fakesink
+
+filesrc will read until it reaches EOF. It will then create a GstEvent
+of type EOS and return it in the _get function. The event will travel
+downstream and will reach the fakesink element. Fakesink will detect
+the event in the _chain function and will call the default handler. The
+default handler will set the element to the paused state. filesrc will
+eventually change its state to PAUSED, probably before sending out the
+event (TBD)
+
+2) filesrc ! fakesink
+
+The app wants to perform a seek on filesrc. It'll call the gst_pad_event()
+on filesrcs src pad with the SEEK event type. The event handler will
+react and change filesrcs internal status. filesrc will return a DISCONT
+event before returning the buffer with the new offset.
+
+3) filesrc ! mpeg2parse video_0! queue ! { mpeg2dec ! xvideosink }
+
+lost of possibilities here: The app can choose to insert a seek event
+on the filesrc element (byte offset), it can insert a byte/time offset
+seek on the video_0 pad of mpeg2parse or it can insert a time seek event
+on mpeg2decs src pad.
+
+the event will travel upstream using the handlers and the intermediate
+elements can convert the event from a time to a byte offset (possibly
+using GstTimeCache to speed up things).
+
+Filesrc will get a byte seek event on its src pad and will proceed as
+in case 2.
+
+As can be seen from this example the app will generate an event in another
+context than those of the plugins, so this will need proper locking.
+
+The app can also choose to insert a flush event on one of the src
+pads. The plugins would clear their cached data and forward the event
+to their upstream peer pad(s).
+
+4)...
+
+Insert impossible case here..

+INITIAL RAMBLINGS
+-----------------
+
+some random ramblings about the event system:
+
+Possible candidates for events
+------------------------------
+
+  - QoS
+  - EOS
+  - Seek
+  - caps nego??
+  - bufferpool get??
+  - ...
+
+Assumptions for events
+----------------------
+
+- They are tied to a pad.
+- get rid of gst_pad_set_*_function (except for the chain/get ones)
+- occur async to dataflow. (need locking?)
+- fixed set of events only for core features. (elements cannot abuse
+     events for doing dataflow)
+
+Questions
+---------
+
+limit the valid directions an event can travel in? ie. Can EOS only 
+travel downstream (left to right)? 
+
+eg. Seek travels upstream, but it makes sense to also make it travel 
+    downstream (the case of a filesink, where we overwrite the header)
+
+
+Setting an event function
+-------------------------

+---------------

+  GstEventType type;
+  GstEventMinorType minor;
+  guint64 timestamp;  /* also sequence number ?? */
+
+  union {
+    /* EOS stuff */

+} GstEventMinorType;  
+
+
+Receiving events
+----------------

+a sample GstEventFunction, the event functions returns TRUE if the event is handled, 
+FALSE otherwise.
+
+gboolean
+gst_anelement_handle_event (GstPad *pad, GstEvent *event)

+This is the current implementation of events, based on an earlier
+document, in this same directory, called "events".
+
+Definition 
+----------
+
+The event system is designed to be a mechanism for _inter_plugin_
+communication. Their scope is therefore limited in a way that they do
+not serve as a way to communicate between plugins and the app (signals
+and properties are still used for plugin-app communication).

+only travel in one direction.

+    handler is implemented for pads that don't implement their own 
+    handler.
+
+  - travel as fast as possible. the rationale is that a seek event should
+    get to the src element ASAP.
+
+
+
+Plugin generated events
+-----------------------
+
+We cover the range of events a plugin can generate and how they
+are supposed to handle them.
+
+* EOS
+
+  when the plugin has no more data to push, it pushes an EOS
+  event and calls gst_element_set_eos.
+
+  _get based plugins should call gst_element_set_eos() before
+  returning the EOS event.
+
+  gst_element_set_eos() will put an element into the PAUSED state
+  and will emit the eos signal to the app.
+
+  Elements receiving the EOS event on a pad should not pull anymore
+  data from that pad (in case of a loop based element).
+  If the plugin cannot operate when it doesn't receive data on that
+  pad, the element should go to EOS too. It does this by pushing 
+  any data it might still have, to the srcpad after which it 
+  pushes an EOS event on thet pad and calls gst_element_set_eos().
+
+  The EOS event will typically originate from a source element, it 
+  will eventually put all elements into the PAUSED state so that the
+  pipeline stops.
+
+  The EOS event is strictly a downstream event.
+
+* DISCONTINUOUS
+
+  The discontinuous event is used to indicate a discontinuity in the
+  stream to downstream elements.  A disctontinuity happens for the
+  following reasons:
+
+   - a source element is sending the first buffers of a stream.
+   - an element has performed a seek operation resulting in a 
+     discontinuity in the data.
+
+  elements that receive a discontinuity event should flush any state
+  they might have and treat the new data as the start of new data.
+  Before sending out the new data the element must send a discont event
+  to the downstream element with at least a GST_FORMAT_TIME or
+  GST_FORMAT_BYTES as the format/value pair (see below).
+
+  a DISCONTINUOUS event has a flush flag. If that flag is set, the
+  element should also remove any buffered data it might have.
+
+  In addition to the flush flag, a DISCONTINUOUS event also caries up
+  to GST_DISCONTINUOUS_MAX_FORMATS format/value pairs. These values
+  might be used by the receiver of the event to resynchronize itself.
+
+  elements that are using a clock must take special actions upon 
+  receiving the DISCONTINUOUS event: they must call 
+  gst_clock_handle_discont() with the GST_FORMAT_TIME value of
+  the discont event.
+  
+  The DISCONTINUOUS event is strictly a downstream event.
+
+
+* SEEK
+ 
+  The seek event is used to reposition  the upstream elements to
+  a new position in the media stream. 
+
+  The seek event caries a bitwise-or of a GstFormat and a GstSeekType.
+
+  An element receiving the seek event on its srcpad should try to
+  reposition itself as closely to the requested location as possible.
+  if the ACCURATE flag is set and it cannot reposition itself with
+  absolute certainty, it should reposition itself well before the 
+  requested position. If the ACCURATE flag is not set, the element
+  is free to choose a suitable position in the stream before or after
+  the requested time.
+
+  If the flush flag is set it should make sure that it pushes the
+  DISCONTINUOUS event the next time it is scheduled, clearing any
+  data it might have buffered.
+
+  The element is free to set the ACCURACY field in the event to notify
+  the originator of the event of the result. If no accuracy is set, it
+  defaults to FUZZY.
+
+  The SEEK event is stricly an upstream event.
+  
+* QOS
+
+  QoS is sent to indicate Quality of Service to the upstream element(s).
+
+  The QOS event is stricly an upstream event.
+
+* FLUSH
+
+  A plugin can send a flush event to its src or sink peer to clear the
+  buffered contents in the pipeline.
+
+
+application generated events 
+----------------------------
+
+The application can insert events into the pipeline at arbirary
+places. This is done by calling gst_pad_send_event() on a pad.
+
+An application can also insert events on any element. The element
+can implement its own handler for these events or it can use
+the default handler, which simply forwards the event to the first
+connected sinkpad of the element. Events to an element are send using
+gst_element_send_event().
+
+This first implementation only covers inserting events on src pads
+since inserting events on sinkpads needs changes to the scheduler.
+
+
+* FLUSH
+
+  A flush event is used to clear any buffered data an element might 
+  have. It is a downstream and upstream event.
+
+  Flush events are typically inserted into the pipeline by the app.
+  Elements that buffer data should implement an event handler on 
+  both the sink and src pads it might have and respond to the flush
+  event by clearing all data they have buffered.
+
+* SEEK
+
+  The application can insert the seek event into the pipeline on
+  a srcpad with gst_pad_send_event () or on an element with 
+  gst_element_send_event().
+
+  The semantics of the seek parameters are described above.
+  
+
+Thread safety
+-------------
+
+All upstream events can occur outside the element's thread context. 
+It is not required to protect the element's data structures with
+mutexes because in principal we don't support sending events to
+a running threaded pipeline.
+
+GstQueue in its current form will refuse to pass events upstream if
+it is in the PLAYING state. Future versions might pass the event
+on as soon as the element is scheduled again on the sinkpad.
+
+An application cannot insert an event on an element that is PLAYING
+in another thread context. It is therefore strongly recommended to
+PAUSE the threaded pipeline before inserting an event.
+
+
+use cases 
+---------
+
+1) filesrc ! fakesink
+
+<< explain EOS >>
+
+
+2) filesrc ! fakesink
+
+The app wants to perform a seek on filesrc. It'll call the gst_pad_send_event()
+on filesrcs src pad with the SEEK event type. The event handler will
+react and change filesrcs internal status. filesrc will return a DISCONT
+event before returning the buffer with the new offset.
+
+3) filesrc ! mpeg2parse video_0! queue ! { mpeg2dec ! xvideosink }
+
+lost of possibilities here: The app can choose to insert a seek event
+on the filesrc element (byte offset), it can insert a byte/time offset
+seek on the video_0 pad of mpeg2parse or it can insert a time seek event
+on mpeg2decs src pad.
+
+the event will travel upstream using the handlers and the intermediate
+elements can convert the event from a time to a byte offset (possibly
+using GstTimeCache to speed up things).
+

+This document contains some ideas that can be used to implement
+interactivity in media content.
+
+Possible application: DVD navigation, flash,...
+
+Requirements
+------------
+
+- capture mouse clicks, mouse position, movement occuring on
+  a video display plugin
+- transport these events to the interested plugins
+- allow for automation (ie, the technique should work without
+  a video plugin too)
+- the core doesn't care
+
+Capturing events
+----------------
+
+- the videosink element captures mouse events
+  - event is encapsulated into a generic data structure
+    describing the event (need to define a caps?)
+  - event is signalled to the app?.
+  - event is sent upstream?
+
+  * videosink has to add something to the main_loop to
+    be able to grab events
+  * thread issues?
+  * does the app need to know about the events?
+  
+- app captures mouse events
+  - no idea if that's possible 
+  - app sends events upstream
+
+Sending events to plugins
+-------------------------
+
+- are sent upstream using the event methods
+  * more generic
+  * less app control
+
+- are sent to the appropriate plugin by the app
+  * app needs to know what plugins are interested,
+    less generic.
+  * more app control
+
+automation will always work, the app can construct navigation
+events and insert them into the pipeline.
+
+What about flushing to minimize latency?
+
+
+Defining an event
+-----------------
+
+some ideas:
+
+GST_CAPS_NEW (
+   "videosink_event",
+   "application/x-gst-navigation"
+     "type", "click",
+     "x_pos", 30,
+     "y_pos", 40
+   )
+     
+GST_CAPS_NEW (

+     "type", "move",
+     "x_pos", 30,
+     "y_pos", 40
+   )
+     
+...
+
+do we need a library for this?
+
+do we use custom events and use the mime type to detect the 
+type? do we creat a GST_EVENT_NAVIGATION?
+
+can we encapsulate all events into a GstCaps? I would think so
+
+Random thoughts
+---------------
+
+- we're basically defining an event model, I don't think there is
+  anything wrong with that.
+- how is our coordinate system going to work? do
+  we use normalized values, 0-1000000 (or floats)
+  or real pixel values? real pixel values require scalers to adjust
+  the values (I don't think I like that)

+OUTDATED
+--------
+
+
+problem 
+-------
+
+Since gstreamer uses a hierarchical pipeline layout individual elements
+can be inside N levels of containers (bins). Elements can also produce
+interesting information for the user app or for its parent.
+
+Consider the mp3parse element that could detect id3 tags in the stream.
+One way to let the app know about those tags is by emitting a signal. The
+problem with this signal is that the app has to perform a g_signal_connect
+on this element. This might not always be possible/feasable because
+the APP might not know about the mp3parse element (eg. an autoplugged
+pipeline or a compound object). The app could instrospect each element
+in the pipeline and look for known properties/signals to connect to,
+but that looks a bit ugly IMO.
+
+Signal proxying is also not very feasable because signals are tied to
+class instances.
+
+let's take the following use case:
+
+ - the user autoplugs an mpeg1 pipeline
+
+ - the autoplugged pipeline most likely contains an mpegdemuxer, an mp3
+   decoder, mpegdecoder etc.
+
+ - the mpegdemuxer knows the (average) bitrate of the stream.
+
+ - the mpegdecoder knows the framerate of the stream
+
+ - the mp3 decoder has some neat stuff too (bitrate, layer etc..)
+
+how are we going to get all those properties to the app? each element
+could fire a signal with the data. It the app were able to connect to
+every signal in each element this would work somewhat.
+
+
+Requirements 
+------------
+
+The application can listen to an abritrary bin in the pipeline to collect
+information about that bins children. The app can listen on the top
+level bin to collect all of the elements messages.
+
+The data sent out by the elements must not be limited to a fixed set of
+messages; it must be extensible.
+
+
+proposed solution 
+-----------------
+
+We propose another way of propagating these element messages to the
+application.
+
+An element can send a message to its parent using a
+gst_element_send_message (element, message). The message would be of type
+GstMessage and would be similar to a GstEvent type (maybe even the same).
+
+The message would contain GstProps, which can be anything (a string, an
+int, a range etc..). It would also contain the originator of the message.
+
+The parent would just simply accept the message (and do something with it)
+or the default handler would just forward the message to its parent etc..
+
+The message would bubble up the pipeline. When an element doesn't have
+a parent, the message is converted to a GSignal. The signal ("message")
+would just forward the message to any listening apps.
+
+The app can then use the originator field of the message to find out
+where it came from, possibly using the elementfactories klass field to
+find out what type of plugin created this message.
+
+For an autoplugged mpeg1 pipeline the following messages could be
+signalled to the app:
+
+element klass        element      property      value
+                     name
+
+stream/mpeg/demuxer: (mpegdemux) "bitrate",   GST_PROPS_INT (1000000)
+stream/mpeg/demuxer: (mpegdemux) "type",      GST_PROPS_STRING ("mpeg1") 
+video/mpeg/decoder:  (mpeg2dec)  "type",      GST_PROPS_STRING ("mpeg1") 
+video/mpeg/decoder:  (mpeg2dec)  "frame_rate",GST_PROPS_INT (25) 
+video/mpeg/decoder:  (mpeg2dec)  "size",      GST_PROPS_LIST (
+                                                 GST_PROPS_INT (320),

+
+
+what about?  
+-----------
+
+- Threads? do we queue events and let the top half collect the messages
+  or do we send them to the app in the thread context?
+
+- do we need a similar system for core functionalities (clocks, states,
+  ...) or do we define methods for those?

+XML namespaces
+==============
+
+1) requirements
+---------------
+
+GStreamer uses XML to save a complete media pipeline. This
+opens a lot of possibilities for end user apps, eg: save
+constructed pipelines for later reuse, send pipelines over
+the wire to render data elsewhere etc...
+
+We will also allow the end user app to insert its own tags
+into the GStreamer generated XML in order to give more
+context to the elements. An example of such an app would be
+gsteditor; while the GStreamer core will save the plain 
+element hierarchy, the editor will insert its own tags into
+the XML tree to describe the elements positions, the 
+signals and other project data that might need to be 
+externalised.
+
+And inherent problem with XML is that the use and naming of
+the tags can be done in an arbitrary way. The GStreamer core
+will, for example, use the 'element' and 'pad' tags to store
+the element and pad objects. The description and the nesting 
+of the tags are described in a DTD (document type definition) 
+or soon with the proposed 'new' standard of the W3C; Schemas.
+
+We can see obvious problems when a user app (unaware of the
+core tags) is also trying to use the 'element' tag for its 
+own purposes. The core might try to load the 'element' tag
+desscribing the user app data and the user app might get fed
+with XML data of the GStreamer core.
+
+In this document we try to describe how we will solve this problem
+using namespaces.
+
+
+2) namespaces
+-------------
+
+To avoid the tag conflicts we mentioned, the W3C has incorporated 
+XML namescapes.
+
+Were a typical XML document without namespaces would look like:
+
+<?xml version="1.0"?>
+<GST-Pipeline>
+ <element>
+  <name>bin</name>
+  <children>
+   ...
+  </children>
+ </element>
+</GST-Pipeline>
+
+Tha same document with namespaces look like this:
+
+<?xml version="1.0"?>
+<gst:GST-Pipeline xmlns:gst="http://gstreamer.net/gst-core/1.0/">
+ <gst:element>
+   <gst:name>bin</gst:name>
+   <gst:children>
+    ...
+   </gst:children>
+ </gst:element>
+</gst:GST-Pipeline>
+
+In front of each tag we add, in this case, gst:. gst: is called the
+namespace of the document and is declared with a statement:
+
+<... xmlns:gst="http://gstreamer.net/gst-core/1.0/">
+
+In this case we define a new namespace 'gst:' that is tied to the URL
+http://gstreamer.net/gst-core/1.0/. This URL is typically based on
+a domain you control and doesn't have to point to something valid on
+the internet. Note that the following document is exactly the same
+as the one mentioned above:
+
+<?xml version="1.0"?>
+<core:GST-Pipeline xmlns:core="http://gstreamer.net/gst-core/1.0/">
+ <core:element>
+   <core:name>bin</gst:name>
+   <core:children>
+    ...
+   </core:children>
+ </core:element>
+</core:GST-Pipeline>
+
+GStreamer currently uses xmlns:gst="http://gstreamer.net/gst-core/1.0" as
+the namespace used for saving the core pipeline.
+
+3) multi-namespace documents
+----------------------------
+
+Suppose we have a user app that wants to insert its own XML tags into
+the core GStreamer XML pipelines, for the examples sake we will use the
+editor as an example.  The editor will insert XML tags inside each
+element that describes the position and size of the element as it was
+laid out in the editor.
+
+For the examples sake, the tags that are used to descibe this meta data
+will also be names 'element' in order to demonstrate the namespaces.
+
+The editor will use its own namespace, being: 
+xmlns:editor="http://gstreamer.net/gst-editor/1.0". This namespace is
+added to the XML documents header and all the elements the editor will
+save will have this namespace attached to it. Our interleaved XML
+document might look like this:
+
+<?xml version="1.0"?>
+<gst:GST-Pipeline xmlns:gst="http://gstreamer.net/gst-core/1.0/"
+                  xmlns:editor="http://gstreamer.net/gst-editor/1.0/">
+  <gst:element>
+    <gst:name>bin</gst:name>
+    <gst:children>
+      ...
+    </gst:children>
+    <editor:element>
+      <editor:position x="100" y="50"/>
+    </editor:element>
+  </gst:element>
+</gst:GST-Pipeline>
+
+As you can see, the namespaces clearly separate the same XML tags
+'element'. 
+
+
+4) implementation considerations
+--------------------------------
+
+The GStreamer core doesn't know about user apps inserting data into the 
+XML, it does not look at XML tags not within its namespace when it 
+performs the parsing of the XML tree. The core, however, must be
+able to hand over the XML tree to the user app so it can perform the
+parsing of its tags inside its namespace. We therefore need hooks inside
+the framework to accomplish this.
+
+We also need hooks inside the GStreamer core to signal a user app that
+it can now insert its tags into the XML tree.
+
+4.1) XML save hooks
+-------------------
+
+GstObject has an abstract class method 
+
+  xmlNodePtr (*save_thyself) (GstObject *object, xmlNodePtr parent)
+
+A real element or pad will implement this function and construct an XML
+representation of itself with the parent xmlNodePtr as the parent.
+An element will typically call the save_thyself function of its
+parent class before saving itself.
+
+The XML save procedure on a GstObject is performed with:
+
+  gst_object_save_thyself (GstObject *object, xmlNodePtr parent)
+
+Wich will call the elements implementation of the save_thyself function.
+
+An app that wants to insert its XML tags has to connect to a signal of
+the GstObject object called xml_saved. The object and the parent
+xmlNodePtr will be passed to the signal handler of the user app, which
+can then insert its tags.
+
+The user app has no problem inserting its namespace into the xmlDoc and
+neither will the GStreamer core.
+
+4.2) XML load hooks
+-------------------
+
+The real problem lies in the loading of the XML tree. Before we load
+the objects, we don't have anything to connect a signal to, so 
+another method has to be invented to signal the user app of the
+freshly loaded objects.
+
+One obvious solution would be to attach a class signal to the 
+GstObject class that would be fired whenever an object is created from
+an XML document. Unfortunatly Gtk+ (or glib2.0) doesn't have class
+signals so we need something else. Another problem with the class 
+signals would be that the user app would also be notified of object
+creation outside its context. For example, if two threads perform an 
+XML load at the same time, the objects created in the first thread
+would also notify the listener in the second thread. Both threads then
+have to take care of not trying to parse XML documents that are from 
+the other thread, this obvously can get messy and we have to deal
+with it without bothering the user app.
+
+We'll continue with some random ramblings...
+
+solution 1
+----------
+To solve this problem we can create a special method in gstobject
+
+gst_object_loaded_notify_add (GstObjectLoadedCallback *callback,
+                              xmlNodePtr doc)
+
+this method would add the specified callback function to a list of 
+listeners and would perform the callback function if an object is 
+created (this can be done in the init method). The problem remains
+though because we do not know the xmlNodePtr when we call the 
+callback. This seems messy.
+
+sultion 2
+---------
+After the object has performed its restore_thyself, it is responsible
+for signaling a object_loaded signal with the object and the xmlNodePtr
+as an argument.
+
+At object creation, the signal is connected to a singleton object managed
+by GstObject that can proxy the signal to the user app. This looks a
+lot like a class signal. apps could also specify the xmlNodePtr they
+are interested in and the signal would only be proxied to the app
+if the xmlNodePtrs are from the same xmlDoc.
+
+Solution 2 seems like a reasonable solution for now...

+Caps Negotiation
+================
+
+
+Definitions
+-----------
+
+- GstCaps is a structure that holds a mimetype and a set of properties. The properties are
+  either fixed or non-fixed, they contain ranges or lists.
+
+- filter caps: caps set by the application to constrain a link to a specific GstCaps.
+
+- allowed caps: caps calculated when connecting elements, these are the types that are
+  possible on this connection. If no types are possible, the link is refused.
+
+- pad template caps: caps put on padtemplates to describe the possible media types of
+  the pad.
+
+- pad caps: the caps of the pad as it is currently negotiated.
+
+
+General overview
+----------------
+
+Caps negotiation is the process of two pads agreeing on a common fixed GstCaps structure
+that describes the media type that will be exchanged between those pads.
+
+We define that caps negotiation only happens in the PLAYING state, when there is actual
+dataflow and elements thus know what kind of data they are dealing with, or when 
+linking elements.
+
+Caps negotiation is first performed when linking elements. If the elements can agree
+on a media type at link time then negotiation will not have to be performed at runtime.
+Usually this is not possible, so the pads remain unnegotiated until at runtime.
+
+Caps negotiation is initiated by an element that wants to send data on a non-negotiated
+pad, thus the source pad. The core only provides a policy and convenience methods to aid 
+the element in performing the negotiation. The core does not keep track of what pads
+are negotiated or not, this is a task of the pads.
+
+Caps negotiation is normally started by the source element right before it sends out 
+data (case 1).
+Caps negotiation can also be redone by a sink element that wants to receive another 
+format from a downstream element (case 2).
+
+There are two functions handling the negotiation, the link function and the do_link
+function. The link function is always called first and must eventually call do_link on
+the peer pad.  The link function must figure out a compatible format for the connection
+and then call the do_link function on the peer pad. The do_link function can only 
+accept or refuse the provided caps.
+
+For autopluggers it is important to know when the pad is ready to start the negotiation.
+It is also inportant to know when the negotiation failed and it must be possible to 
+restart the negotiation with another element. This functionality will be provided
+with signals.
+
+Pad functions
+-------------
+
+!
+! const GstCaps* gst_pad_iterate_caps (GstPad *pad, gint position);
+!
+Returns the nth possible caps that describes the media type that can flow over
+this pad. This function should not return static caps but caps that are 
+dependent of the media type and the peer connections of the element.
+
+This function can be called at any time so that an autoplugger can know the
+exact types of the pads at any time.
+
+!
+! gboolean gst_pad_accept_caps (GstPad *pad, GstCaps *caps);
+!
+Checks that a given caps is acceptable for this pad. Returns FALSE if the
+pad cannot handle the caps.
+
+!
+! gboolean gst_pad_link (GstPad *pad, GstPad *peer, GstCaps *caps);
+!
+Tells the pad to start negotiation with the given filtercaps. The
+caps need not be fixed and serves as a filter for performing the negotiation
+with the peerpad. 
+
+!
+! gboolean gst_pad_do_link (GstPad *pad, GstPad *peer, GstCaps *caps);
+!
+Configures the pad to accept data with the given caps.  The caps must be fixed. 
+
+!
+! const GstCaps* gst_pad_get_negotiated_caps (GstPad *pad);
+!
+Get the negotiated caps of a pad or NULL if the pad is not negotiated.
+
+
+Linking Elements
+----------------
+
+When linking elements with the gst_pad_link function, the core will call
+the link function on the srcpad. If that pad returns GST_PAD_LINK_OK,
+the link is established, else the link fails.
+
+Since the link function of the pad will call the do_link function of
+the peerpad, the caps will be set on both pads.
+
+It is not required to decide on a caps at link time, a plugin can choose to
+dynamically renegotiate at runtime.
+
+When a link fails, the core emits a signal link_failed, which the application
+can catch to try to establish a new link with another element, for example.
+
+!
+! def gst_pad_link_filtered (pad1, pad2, filtercaps):
+!
+!   ... get srcpad and sinkpad ...
+!   srcpad  = (pad1 == GST_PAD_SRC ? pad1 : pad2);
+!   sinkpad = (pad1 == GST_PAD_SINK ? pad1 : pad2);
+!
+!   ... more checks to see if the pads are of different types and
+!   ... that they live in the same scheduler etc...
+!
+!   res = gst_pad_link (srcpad, sinkpad, filtercaps)
+!   if (res == GST_PAD_LINK_OK)
+!     ... perform other setup ...
+!   else
+!     res = signal_emit (srcpad, "link_failed")
+!
+!   return res
+!
+
+Pad link is just a convenience function that passes a NULL filtercaps:
+! 
+! def gst_pad_link (pad1, pad2):
+!   gst_pad_link_filtered (pad1, pad2, NULL)
+!
+
+
+Dynamic renegotiation
+---------------------
+
+Dynamic renegotiation happens at runtime when the element knows the exact media
+type it is handling.
+
+The element that wants to redecide on the data type of a connection just calls
+gst_pad_relink on one of it's pads. The core will call unlink and link on the
+pads again as if this were a new connection. Since the iterate_caps function
+returns other values while linking, the new link will renegotiate to a new
+format or the link will fail.
+
+Prototype of the relink function:
+!
+! def gst_pad_relink_filtered (pad, filtercaps):
+!   gst_pad_unlink (pad, peerpad)
+!   gst_pad_link_filtered (pad, peerpad, filtercaps)
+!
+
+Again the relink function is a convenience function for not having to pass 
+filtercaps.
+!
+! def gst_pad_relink (pad):
+!   gst_pad_relink_filtered (pad, NULL)
+!
+
+The core, however, should optimize the relink function so that it does a minimal
+amount of work, like not informing the scheduler about the unlink/link call in
+case of success.
+
+Error recovery
+--------------
+
+When a pad is ready to negotiate and it has no peer pad, it fires the "need-link"
+signal. Autopluggers can use this signal to start plugging elements to the pad.
+
+When a link fails because of a renegotiation, the "link-failed" signal is fired
+so that autopluggers can try other elements.
+
+
+Default implementations
+-----------------------
+
+!
+! gst_pad_src_link_func (pad, peerpad, filtercaps) 
+! {
+!   srcpad->negotiated_caps = NULL;
+!   gboolean possible = FALSE;
+!
+!   for (i=0; peercaps = gst_pad_iterate_caps (peerpad, i); i++) 
+!   {
+!     for (j=0; srccaps = gst_pad_iterate_caps (srcpad, j); j++) 
+!     {
+!       test = gst_caps_intersect (srccaps, peercaps, filtercaps);
+!       if (test == GST_CAPS_EMPTY)
+!         continue;
+!
+!       /* non empty caps, something is possible */
+!       possible = TRUE;
+!
+!       if (!gst_caps_is_fixed (caps))
+!         continue;
+!
+!       if (gst_pad_accepts_caps (peerpad, test))
+!       {
+!         if (gst_pad_do_link (peerpad, srcpad, test))
+!         {
+!           srcpad->negotiated_caps = test;
+!           goto done;
+!         }
+!         else
+!         {
+!           /* weird, it accepted but did not want to link */
+!         }
+!       }
+!       else
+!       {
+!         /* caps are not accepted by peer, try next */
+!       }
+!     }
+!   }
+! done:
+!   if (!possible)
+!     return GST_PAD_LINK_FAILED;
+!   else
+!     return GST_PAD_LINK_OK;
+! }
+!
+
+gst_pad_iterate_caps returns caps in the following order:
+
+ 1) prefered caps (if any)
+ 2) negotiated caps (if any)
+ 3) profile caps (if any, filtered against caps of current media type)
+ 4) padtemplate caps (filtered against caps of current media type)
+
+1 = a caps describing the media type that would result in optimal
+    processing of the current media type
+2 = a caps that it is currently handling
+3 = a caps describing the user configured default values
+4 = a caps describing all other possibilities that this pad can
+    produce or consume given the current media type if any.

+Network Transparent elements
+----------------------------
+
+1) netbin
+
+   - exposes local shims and remote real elements.
+   - all shim pads can be connected to other shim
+     pads and operations are proxied to real elements.
+   - when the pads are not part of the same bin, network
+     transparent ghostpads are created to connect them.
+   - bin has host property to indicate where it should
+     run.
+
+2) netpipeline
+
+   - synchronizes different netbins, this means distributing
+     the same element base time to the remote bins.
+   - clocks master/slave is set up.
+
+3) netpad
+
+   - all pad operations are proxied to peer pad using
+     a network protocol, possibly selectable from RTP/TCP/....
+     Serialisation of buffers and events are to be considered
+     but also methods with their arguments. A generator would
+     not be too bad to automate this.
+   - the implementation would be fairly similar to the
+     ghostpad implementation.
+   - This includes event passing (bidirectional) and
+     data passing (unidirectional). Some events have to pass
+     in parallel with the datastream so the event path should
+     use a different connection.
+     
+4) GStreamer deamon
+
+   - each host has to run a deamon that listens for
+     commands and creates elements/pipelines and performs all
+     operations on the real pipeline.
+
+Other stuff
+-----------
+
+ - what about migrating elements from one host to another. This
+   would happen when an element is removed form a bin into another
+   bin. 
+
+ - do we have/need a fast protocol for stuff on the same machine or
+   will regular network connections work fine?

+Fixing Performance
+------------------
+
+1) Observations 
+
+ The following observations are made when considering the current (17/11/2004)
+ problems in gstreamer.
+
+ - startup time.
+   Most of the time is spend in reading the xml registry. Several methods exist
+   for not using a registry (see testsuite/plugin/).
+   Since registries are pluggable, one can also write a binary registry which
+   should significantly reduce the size and the load time.
+
+ - Performance in state changes
+   State changes are pretty heavy currently because negotiation happens at
+   each state change. The PAUSED->PLAYING state change in particular is
+   too heavy and should be made more 'snappy'.
+   
+ - Performance in data passing.
+   Too much checking is done in the push/pull functions. Most of these checks
+   can be performed more efficiently in the plugins, like checking if the
+   element is sufficiently negotiated. The discont event 'invent' hack used
+   for fixing the synchronisation has to go away.
+   
+   We also propose a get_range based method for pads so that random-access 
+   in file-based sources can happen more efficiently (typical for muxers).
+
+ - Scheduling overhead.
+   The current default opt scheduler has extensive data-structures and does
+   uses fairly complicated algorithms for grouping and scheduling elements.
+   This has performance impact on pipeline constructions and pipeline 
+   execution.
+
+ - Events in dataflow.
+   Because events are put inside the dataflow, a typical chain function has
+   to check if the GstData object is an event of a buffer. 
+   
+
+2) Proposed solutions
+
+ - startup time.
+   Volunteers to implement a binary registry?
+
+ - The changes listed in the separate document 'threading' will greatly
+   reduce the number of negotiation steps during state changes. It will
+   also reduce the latency between PAUSED<->PLAYING since it basically
+   involves unlocking a mutex in the sinks.
+
+ - adding return values to push/pull will offload some checks to the plugins
+   that can more efficiently and more accuratly handle most error cases.
+   With the new sync model in 'threading' it is also not needed to have
+   the 'invented' events in the pull function.
+
+ - The following scheduling policies should be made possible for pads:
+
+    1) get_range <-> pull-range-based
+    2) get       <-> pull based
+    3) push      <-> chain-based
+    
+   The scheduling policies are listed in order of preference. A pad should
+   export what scheduling it supports and the core will select what 
+   scheduling method to use. It is possible for a pad to support more than
+   one scheduling method.
+
+   It is possible that two elements cannot connect when they do not support
+   compatible scheduling policies. We require that pull-based pads also
+   support the chain based methods, at minimal, using a helper function to 
+   queue a buffer and that get-based pads also support a push based implementation.
+
+ - With the changes listed in 'threading' the scheduler will be a lot more
+   simple since it does not have to keep track of groups and connected 
+   elements. Starting and scheduling the pipeline will be a matter of
+   starting the source/loop GstTasks and they will from there on take
+   over.
+
+ - move events out of the dataflow. Different methods will be used to
+   send/receive events. This will also remove some of the checks in
+   the push/pull functions. Note that plugins are still able to serialize
+   buffers and events because they hold the streaming lock.
+
+3) detailed explanation

+In this document we describe how we can obtain various properties
+of the pipeline we are running.
+
+we have 5 possible ways to get information, each one of these
+methods focus on one particular property of the pipeline.
+
+ - caps: this is a description of the media type that flows between
+         2 pads.
+ - metadata: non essential extra (human readable) information about
+         the stream, like author, copyright, name etc..
+ - streaminfo: information about the stream as encoded into the
+         stream itself.
+ - pad/element queries: information about the stream as it is being
+         processed.
+ - pad/element convert: information about the relation between formats
+         in a streams as it is being processed.
+
+note that element properties are not included in this list. Element
+properties are only used to configure the codec/element.
+
+caps, metadata, streaminfo are supposed to remain fairly static during
+the stream. The queries/converts can be done on demand.  The reason
+for this is that caps/metadata/streaminfo is quite expensive and 
+could degrade pipeline performance.
+
+
+Caps.
+-----
+
+Caps are automatically set on pads by the core when two pads agree
+on a media type. This automatically means that the caps are fixed.
+
+Since caps is a property of the pad and the g_object_notify() mechanism
+is used to signal a change, the user can either connect a "notify" 
+signal handler to the pad or connect to the "deep_notify" signal on
+a parent pipeline.
+
+The caps notifications are useful if you want to know what kind of
+media is passing through pads. You can, for example, report to the
+user how the video or audiosink is configured or what kind of
+media some plugin is producing/accepting.
+
+So, always use the caps to find out the channels/samplerate/size
+of the media.
+
+
+Metadata
+--------
+
+Metadata is a GstCaps element property (named "metadata") that contains
+additional information encoded into the stream that doesn't say anything
+about the media type of the stream itself.
+
+Metadata are typically human readable information like author, copyright,
+title, ... and can be displayed by the application as-is.
+
+An element with a "metadata" property is supposed to g_object_notify that
+property when the metadata changes so that the app can connect a signal
+handler to the property or use the "deep_notify" signal to get the 
+notification.
+
+
+Streaminfo
+----------
+
+Streaminfo is a GstCaps element property (named "streaminfo") that contains
+additional information about the stream that is not stricly required to
+specify the media type of the stream.
+
+Streaminfo is typically the length, bitrate, framerate, flags, ... of the
+stream. 
+
+It is important to note that this information should be derived from the 
+stream itself and might not be correct for the pipeline being processed.
+Let's illustrate this with an example:
+
+ - an mp3 stream has an id3 tags that contains the length of the stream 
+   (TLEN).
+ - we cut the mp3 stream in half
+
+ The actual length doesn't match the stated length as encoded in the id3
+ tags, so the TLEN tag should be put in the streaminfo and the actual
+ length should be queried with a pad_query.
+
+So, be careful when showing streaminfo as-is in an app.
+
+Queries
+-------
+
+Queries can be performed on pads and elements and are used to get 
+information about the current stream. The value is a single gint64
+in a specific format. 
+
+example:
+
+ - the query (GST_QUERY_TOTAL, GST_FORMAT_TIME) will return the total
+   amount of time this pad/element will run.
+
+ - the query (GST_QUERY_POSITION, GST_FORMAT_UNITS) will return the 
+   current position of the stream expressed in units (units are samples,
+   frames, bytes, ... depending on the media type of the stream)
+
+two methods exist to perform a query:
+
+ - gboolean gst_pad_query (GstPad *pad, GstQueryType type, 
+                           GstFormat *format, gint64 *value);
+
+and:
+
+ - gboolean gst_element_query (GstElement *element, GstQueryType type, 
+                               GstFormat *format, gint64 *value);
+
+if you want to get the total duration of a stream or the current position,
+you need to use a pad query. A pad query can fail (method returns FALSE),
+this usually means that the duration is not known or that not enough data
+has been processed to report the correct value.
+
+the possible queries that can be performed on a pad/element can be obtained
+with
+
+ - const GstQueryType* gst_pad_get_query_types (GstPad *pad);
+ 
+and
+
+ - const GstQueryType* gst_element_get_query_types (GstElement *element);
+
+These functions return an array of GstQueryTypes (last element == 0). you
+can loop over the array to see what is supported or do 
+
+ - gboolean gst_queries_contains (const GstQueryType *types, GstQueryType type);
+
+to see if a specific format is contained in the list.
+
+The value reported by a pad query can be considered correct or 
+as-good-as-can-be. Elements that support pad queries must do the best
+they can to report correct values.
+
+
+Convert
+-------
+
+The convert functions are used to query an element/pad for the relationship
+between two formats that it supports. For example:
+
+suppose we want to know how many frames a particular video decoder will
+produce in one second, we ask it to convert its concept of 1 SECOND into
+1 UNIT (frames in the context of video). so,
+
+ GstFormat format = GST_FORMAT_UNITS;
+ 
+ res = gst_pad_convert (pad, GST_FORMAT_TIME, GST_SECOND,
+                        &format, &value);
+
+if res == TRUE, value will contain the framerate of the video, of course 
+this framerate will only contain the integral part. If you want more
+accuracy, use 1000 * GST_SECOND and divide the result by 1000 to get
+a fractional part.
+
+All other neat things can be done too, look at the typical cdplayer
+plugin for example. It defines a new format "track". Now you can
+ask it to convert a TRACK to TIME like this:
+
+
+ GstFormat format = GST_FORMAT_TIME;
+ track_format = gst_format_get_by_nick ("track");
+ res = gst_pad_convert (pad, track_format, 1,
+                        &format, &value);
+
+
+This will convert 1 track to a time. of course we didn't (couldn't) specify
+which track, but that's not a problem if you understand how the stream is
+divided into different formats:
+
+Take the total stream as containing bytes (indicated with + in figure) we 
+can subdivide the (byte)stream in different formats.
+
+
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ... bytes
+!   !   !   !   !   !   !   !   !   !   !   !   !   !   !   !   !    ... samples (units)
+!                   !               !                   !            ... buffers
+!                            !                                !      ... time
+!                                                              !     ... track
+
+The raw bytestream can be grouped in samples for example (for 16 bit stereo
+int audio, 4 bytes == 1 sample) or we can divide it into time 
+(44100 samples == 176400 bytes == 1 second) or into tracks 
+(1 track could be 17640000 bytes or 100 seconds or 4410000 samples)
+
+It is important to know that the stream starts at position 0 (for all formats)
+and ends at position X (expressed in a specific format). now take this stream
+divided into the track format:
+
+0        200         500       700          1000
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ .. bytes
+! track0  ! track1    ! track2  ! track3     ! ...
+
+if we now perform a pad convert from 100 bytes to the track format, we
+get the value 0, as the region 0-100 bytes is contained in track0.
+if we perform a pad convert from 600 bytes to track, we get the value
+2, as track0->track2 contains the bytes 0-500.
+
+We can also do: convert track1 to bytes, then we get 200. If we do
+convert track2 to bytes, we get 500. Note that the conversions are
+always performed relative to 0, so if we convert track2 to bytes, we
+always get the number of bytes from track0->track2.
+
+If we want to get the number of bytes of one particular track, we have
+to substract two convert values. Look at the folowing figure to understand
+this. The --- defines the region we want to convert.
+
+
+0        200         500       700          1000
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ .. bytes
+! track0  ! track1    ! track2  ! track3     ! ...
+
+-----------             track1 -> bytes (1) (size of track0)
+
+----------------------  track2 -> bytes (2) (size of track0 and track1)
+
+           -----------  (2) - (1) = total bytes for track 1
+
+Another example would be to get the bitrate of a decoder plugin, consider the
+following example:
+
+     (------------)
+     ! mad        !
+  - sink         src -
+     (------------)
+
+The element has a sinkpad that will take N bytes as input to produce M
+samples (units) on its srcpad.
+The rate at which it takes bytes is defined as the byterate of the 
+stream (bitrate == byterate * 8). So, we do:
+
+ GstFormat format = GST_FORMAT_BYTES;
+ gint64 value;
+ 
+ gst_pad_convert (mad->sinkpad, GST_FORMAT_TIME, GST_SECOND,
+                  &format, &value);
+
+..and we get the number of bytes this plugin takes in each second.
+Again, note that this value is relative to 0, you can get an average
+of a specific period by using the same substract trick as above.
+
+
+Element Properties
+------------------
+
+Element properties are used to configure an element. They should not be
+used to describe media info, metadata fields, streaminfo fields or anything
+other that doesn't involve codec configuration.
+
+Several reasons:
+
+ - metadata requires dynamic properties (one for each tag). This cannot be done
+   with GObject properties.
+ - you cannot signal a logical group of related properties (exposing stuff like
+   samplerate/channels/encoding/... in different element properties is not a
+   good idea.
+ - stuff like length an position depend on the pads of the element, you cannot
+   sanely expose a property for each pad to describe this.
+ - element properties can only report stuff with one type. If your property
+   exposes somthing like "total_length", you cannot make it both report this
+   in time/bytes/samples/frames...
+ - impossible to sanely implement convert with element properties.

+
+This short document gives some guidelines to plugin writers.
+
+
+chain-based plugins
+===================
+
+ - the plugin has a chain function on each sink pad (can be the same function)
+
+! 
+! chain (GstPad *pad, GstBuffer *buffer) 
+! {
+!   MyElement *elem = MY_ELEMENT (gst_pad_get_parent (pad));
+!   GstBuffer *new_buffer;
+! 
+!   ...
+!   (process the buffer)
+!   ...
+! 
+!   /* you can push as many buffers (0 or more) as you want */
+!   while (!done) {
+!     ...
+!     (process some more
+!     ...
+!     gst_pad_push (elem->some_sink_pad, new_buffer);
+!     ...
+!     /* if you're like going to send a large amount of buffers
+!      * it's a good idea to call _yield from time to time after
+!      * the buffer has been pushed */
+!     (optional gst_element_yield (GST_ELEMENT (elem)); )
+!   }
+! }
+! 
+
+ - chain based functions are usually easy and recommended.
+ - use gst_element_yield if you are going to push a lot of buffers.
+
+
+
+loop-based plugins
+==================
+
+ - one loop function for the element.
+ - required for bytestream based plugins.
+
+simple case
+-----------
+  
+ - one pull at the start
+
+ - if you do something like this, you really should consider using a 
+   chain function as it can be significantly optimised by the scheduler.

+! {
+!   MyElement *elem = MY_ELEMENT (element);
+!   GstBuffer *buffer;
+!   GstBuffer *new_buffer;
+! 
+!   buffer = gst_pad_pull (elem->sinkpad);
+!  
+!   ...
+!   (do something)
+!   ...
+!
+!   /* you can push as many buffers (0 or more) as you want */
+!   while (!done) {
+!     ...
+!     (process some more
+!     ...
+!     gst_pad_push (elem->some_sink_pad, new_buffer);
+!     ...
+!     /* if you're like going to send a large amount of buffers
+!      * it's a good idea to call _yield from time to time after
+!      * the buffer has been pushed */
+!     (optional gst_element_yield (GST_ELEMENT (elem)); )
+!   }
+! }
+!
+
+DONT!!
+
+- infinite loop
+
+!
+! loop (element)
+! {
+!   while (TRUE) {
+!     ...
+!     _pull ()
+!     ...
+!
+!     ...
+!     _push ()
+!     ...
+!   }
+! }
+!
+
+* you can fix this by either:
+
+ - setting the GST_ELEMENT_INFINITE_LOOP flag on the element. this is
+   not recommended, if all plugins in the pipeline (or depending on the
+   pipeline, some plugins) have this flag, the pipeline will not run.
+ - calling break; from time to time to get out of the loop. (duh, then
+   it's not an infinite loop anymore). beware that the next time the loop
+   function is called, it will be started from the top.
+ - calling gst_element_yield() from time to time (see NOTES). 
+ - this is fine (albeit rather useless, use a chain function):
+  !
+  ! loop (element)
+  ! {
+  !   ...
+  !   _pull ()
+  !   ...
+  !
+  !   ...
+  !   _push ()
+  !   ...
+  ! }
+  !
+ - so is this (albeit rather useless, consider removing the while and the _yield):
+  !
+  ! loop (element)
+  ! {
+  !   while (TRUE) {
+  !     ...
+  !     _pull ()
+  !     ...
+  !
+  !     ...
+  !     _push ()
+  !     ...
+  !     gst_element_yield (element);
+  !   }
+  ! }
+  !
+
+
+DONT!!
+
+- allocate data, loop, free data
+
+!
+! loop (element)
+! {
+!   
+!   (my funky malloc)
+!
+!   while (TRUE) {
+!
+!     ...
+!     _pull ()
+!     ...
+!
+!     ...
+!     _push ()
+!     ...
+!
+!     _yield ()
+!   }
+!
+!   (my funky free)
+!
+! }
+!
+
+ - the free will NEVER happen!.
+
+* You can fix this by:
+
+ - allocating/freeing data in the state change function
+ - you could think the following code would work too:
+  !
+  ! (*WRONG* example follows)
+  !
+  ! loop (element)
+  ! {
+  !   
+  !   (my funky malloc)
+  !
+  !   while (TRUE) {
+  !
+  !     ...
+  !     _pull ()
+  !     if (EOS)
+  !       break;
+  !
+  !     ...
+  !     _push ()
+  !     ...
+  !
+  !     _yield ()
+  !   }
+  !
+  !   (my funky free)
+  !
+  ! }
+  !
+   but it'll only free the data if the pipeline was shut down with
+   and EOS so don't try it. Besides, on EOS, a state change will happen
+   anyway so free the data there.
+
+
+bytestream/multiple pull case
+-----------------------------
+
+ - same as the simple case, but you can't use a chain based function unless
+   you want to make things a little harder then they should be.
+
+
+complicated case
+----------------
+
+ - push and pull are completely mixed.
+ - the flow is usually something like this:
+
+!
+! loop (element)
+! {
+!   
+!   while (TRUE) {
+!
+!     while (something) {
+!       ...
+!       do some _pull ()
+!       ...
+!       do some _push ()
+!       ...
+!       while (something_else) {
+!         ...
+!         if (testing)
+!           do some _pull ()
+!         ...
+!         do some _push ()
+!       }
+!     }
+!
+!     while (something_useful) {
+!       ...
+!       _push ()
+!       ...
+!     }
+!   }
+! }
+!
+(example made complicated on purpose, but vorbisdec comes close)
+
+ - you cannot call break to avoid infinite loops and there are loops that 
+   take a significant amount of time to execute, possibly pushing/pulling
+   a lot of buffers.
+
+* You can fix this by:
+
+ - inserting gst_element_yield () in sane places, don't exagerate because
+   every yield can potentially never return so you need to keep track of
+   allocations (see the NOTES below).
+ 
+
+
+NOTES:
+======
+
+ - a call to _yield() can never return. if you have data allocated on the
+   stack before the yield, keep a pointer to it in the element struct 
+   and free it in the state change function.
+
+
+IMPLEMENATION DETAILS
+=====================
+
+The infinite loops are only problematic if the scheduler chooses to select
+the plugin as an entry point in the chain. _yield() will be a nop if this is
+not the case. The scheduler will not select plugins with the INFINITE_LOOP
+flag set as entries in a chain.
+
+A _yield in an entry will hand over control to the main thread context, allowing
+state changes and other actions to be performed. It will basically exit the 
+_iterate() function. spending a long time in a loop will degrade app responsiveness
+because _iterate will take a long time.
+
+Calling yield, pulling, pushing can potentially never return because a state change
+might have happened, killing off execution of the plugin. pulling/pushing buffers
+will cause no leaks in this case because the core will free pending buffers in a
+state change to READY. The plugin must free allocated data/buffers itself in the state
+change function if the yield didn't retrun.

+    - a get based plugin as the entry point
+
+Scheduling the group is a matter of starting the cothread and calling
+the loop function or doing a _get/_push on a srcpad.

+Chaining
+--------
+
+ * groups that are connected end up in the same chain
+ * a group always belongs to a chain
+ * updating the chain is only needed when two groups are
+   connected with a connection of type E/F. for other
+   connection types, the group itself is updated.
+ * a chain is scheduled by scheduling a random group in the chain.
+
+
+Wrapper functions
+-----------------
+
+
+
+iterating without cothreads
+---------------------------
+
+A cothread for each group is the easiest way to schedule most of
+the pipelines. Some pipelines are however schedulable without
+any cothreads.
+
+Each group is schedulable without cothreads, one can call the
+group schedule function and be done with it. Problems arise
+one the group boundaries of connected elements, which are always 
+of type E and F (chain->loop, loop->loop)
+
+We always have a producer group and a provider group in this case.
+
+chain->loop
+-----------
+
+
+
+Scheduler algorithm
+-------------------
+
+1: select (random?) group in chain
+2: schedule group
+3: on E/F connections, the get/chain wrapper is called
+   - get wrapper puts the peer element on the runqueue and
+     recursively invokes the scheduler.
+   - chain wrapper puts the buffer in the bufpen and puts
+     the peer element in the runqueue
+4: when the group is scheduled, take group from the runqueue
+   and goto 2:
+5: no more groups on the runqueue, iteration ends
+
+
+NOTES:
+
+- We need a GList instead of a single bufpen to hold buffers
+  for multi-out elements.
+  
+- We probably need to set a limit on the maximum number of
+  recursions and size of the bufpen list.
+
+- elements run non-preemptively, a group is done scheduling when all
+  elements in that group complete their chain/loop function.
+
+- can we only have a stack overflow when there is a loop in the
+  pipeline? I think so.
+
+- putting groups twice on the runqueue is not a good idea, we
+  need to check a flag or something, maybe give the group a 
+  higher priority?
+
+- what about starvation? We'll probably have to put the group
+  at the end of the runqueue.
+
+- multi-out elements can introduce significant latency. consider:
+
+  (-group1----------) (-group2-----------------)
+  !                 ! !                        !
+  ! *filesrc -> mad --> *%identity -> osssink  !
+  (-----------------) (------------------------)
+
+  mad produces N output buffers, they are queued in the bufpen, when
+  group1 is done, group2 is scheduled to empty the bufpen queue.
+
+  The time it takes for the first buffer to arrive at osssink equals
+  the time needed to decode the N-1 other buffers.
+
+  Of course, given the right buffersize for filesrc, N can be reduced
+  to 1. mad can also suggest a buffersize to filesrc with the 
+  BUFFER_SIZE event.
+
+
+
+Ungrouping
+----------
+
+Ungrouping might be the hardest part. especially in the case where
+an element is still running (state changes and pipeline modifications
+in element callbacks).
+
+Ungrouping involves two tasks:
+
+ - breaking up groups. This can happen when a pad connection is broken
+   so that the group contains two clusters of unconnected elements.
+ - breaking up chains. This happens when a pad connection is broken
+   so that the chains contains two clusters of unconnected groups.
+
+
+case1
+-----
+
+The most simple case is where two elements are disconnected and one
+of the elements does not belong to a group. In this case, we don't need
+to do anything at all.
+
+case2
+-----
+
+if the elements are part of different groups, we need to check if the
+chain needs to be broken. A chain is broken if it contains two sets
+of unconnected groups.
+
+To test this case, we will create a new chain and recursively move
+one of the groups with all of its connected groups to it. If the
+origial chain is empty after this operation, there was still a connection
+and the new chain replaces the old one, else we end up with two chains.
+
+case3
+-----
+
+When the elements are part of the same group we check if both elements
+still have a connection to some other element in that group. The elements
+without connections are removed from the group. 
+
+It is possible that when an element still has a connection with some other
+element in the group, the group has to be split up anyway. This can happen
+in fakesrc ! indentity ! identity ! fakesink when we break the connection
+between the two identity elements. We have to be careful here in the cothread
+case that we don't take away the running cothread from under the elements.
+In the non-cothread case we can just move the elements to another new group.
+
+
+Interrupt with cothreadless optimal scheduler
+---------------------------------------------
+
+Interrupts are usually performed when a blocking _get based source or
+decoupled element is unlocked for a state change. The idea of the 
+interrupt scheduler call is to return to the main execution stack frame
+ASAP so that the state change can take place. For cothread based
+implementations of the scheduler this is not a problem as one can jump
+to the main cothread context without problems. For non cothread based
+schedulers we need to follow this scheme:
+
+get <-> chain based connection.
+
+ - enter get group scheduler
+   - call _get function on source, this can block internally
+   - app performs state change, element is told to unlock itself
+   - lock inside the get based function unlocks and _get function
+     return GST_EVENT_INTERRUPT
+   - group scheduler notices the event, unrefs it and jumps out of the
+     get_group_scheduler function, a scheduler INTERRUPTED flag is set.
+
+get <-> loop based connection
+
+  - enter loop group scheduler
+    - loop based element does pull on sinkpad
+    - _get blocks
+    - app performs state change, _get is unlocked and returns 
+      GST_EVENT_INTERRUPT.
+    - loop based function receives INTERRUPT event and exits its loop
+      ASAP using gst_element_interrupt.
+
+loop/chain <-> loop based connection
+
+  - when returning from the recursive call to the scheduler, the state
+    of the scheduler is checked, if it was interrupted, a
+    GST_EVENT_INTERRUPTED event is returned to the loop based element.
+  - the loop based element exits its loop ASAP.
+      
+
+This technique will unwind the stack of scheduled groups ASAP and returns
+to the main execution stack frame where the iterate() function can return
+and the state change can take place.
+
+Another alternative could be implemented when the _push and _pull functions
+would return a result code...

+Fixing Threading
+----------------
+
+1) Observations 
+
+ The following observations are made when considering the current (17/11/2004)
+ problems in gstreamer.
+
+ - Bin state changes.
+   Currently the state of a bin is determined by the highest state of the 
+   children, This is in particular a problem for GstThread because a thread
+   should start/stop spinning at any time depending on the state of a child.
+   
+    ex 1:
+
+    +-------------------------------------+
+    | GstThread                           |
+    | +--------+   +---------+   +------+ |
+    | | src    |   | decoder |   | sink | |
+    | |       src-sink      src-sink    | |
+    | +--------+   +---------+   +------+ |
+    +-------------------------------------+
+
+   When performing the state change on the GstThread to PLAYING, one of the
+   children (at random) will go to PLAYING first, this will trigger a method
+   in GstThread that will start spinning the thread. Some elements are not yet
+   in the PLAYING state when the scheduler starts iterating elements. This
+   is not a clean way to start the data passing.
+
+   State changes also trigger negotiation and scheduling (in the other thread)
+   can do too. This creates races in negotiation.
+
+ - ERROR and EOS conditions triggering a state change
+
+   A typical problem is also that since scheduling starts while the state change
+   happens, it is possible that the elements go to EOS or ERROR before the
+   state change completes. Currently this makes the elements go to PAUSED again,
+   creating races with the state change in progress. This also gives the 
+   impression to the core that the state change failed. 
+
+ - no locking whatsoever
+
+   When an element does a state change, it is possible for another thread to 
+   perform a conflicting state change. 
+
+ - negotiation is not designed to work over multithread boundaries.
+
+   negotiation over a queue is not possible. There is no method or policy of
+   discovering a media type and then commiting it. It is also not possible to
+   tie the negotiated media to the relevant buffer. 
+
+   ex1:
+     it Should be possible to queue the old and the new formats in a queue.
+     The element connected to the sinkpad of the queue should be able to
+     find out that the new format will be accepted by the element connected
+     on the srcpad of the queue, even if that element is streaming the old
+     format.
+
+      +------------------------------+
+      | GstQueue                     |
+      |   +++++++++++++++++++++++++  |

+           buffers in   buffers in 
+           new format   old format
+                 
+  - element properties are not threadsafe
+
+    When setting an element property while streaming, the element does no
+    locking whatsoever to guarantee its internal consistency.
+
+  - No control over streaming.
+
+    When some GstThread is iterating and you want to reconnect a pad, there
+    is no way to block the pad, perform the actions and then unblock it
+    again. This leads to thread problems where a pad is negotiation at the
+    same time that it is passing data.
+
+    This is currently solved by PAUSING the pipeline or performing the actions
+    in the same threadcontext as the iterate loop.
+
+  - race conditions in synchronizing the clocks and spinning up the pipeline.
+    Currently the clock is started as soon as the pipeline is set to playing.
+    Because some time elaspes before the elements are negotiated, autoplugged
+    and streaming, the first frame/sample almost always arrives late at the
+    sinks. Hacks exist to adjust the element base time to compensate for the
+    delay but this clearly is not clean.
+
+  - race conditions when performing seeks in the pipeline. Since the elements
+    have no control over the streaming threads, they cannot block them or
+    resync them to the new seek position. It is also hard to synchronize them
+    with the clock.
+
+  - race conditions when sending tags and error messages up the pipeline 
+    hierarchy. These races are either caused by glib refcounting problems and
+    by not properly locking.
+  
+  - more as changes are implemented and testcases are written
+
+2) possible solutions
+
+  - not allowing threading at all
+
+    Run the complete pipeline in a single thread. Complications to solve include
+    handling of blocking operations like source elements blocking in kernel
+    space, sink elements blocking on the clock or kernel space, etc.. In practice,
+    all operations should be made non-blocking because a blocking element can
+    cause the rest of the pipeline to block as well and cause it to miss a deadline.
+    A non-blocking model needs cooperation from the kernel (with callbacks) or
+    requires the use of a polling mechanism, both of which are either impractical
+    or too CPU intensive and in general not achievable for a general purpose
+    Multimedia framework. For this reason we will not go further with this
+    solution.
+
+  - Allow threading.
+
+    To make this work, We propose the following changes:
+
+    - Remove GstThread, it does not add anything useful in a sense that you cannot
+      arbitrarily place the thread element, it needs decoupled elements around the
+      borders.
+
+    - Simplify the state changes of bins elements. A bin or element never changes
+      state automatically on EOS and ERROR.
+
+    - Introduce the concept of the application and the streaming thread. All data
+      passing is done in the streaming thread. This also means that all operations
+      either are performed in the application thread or streaming thread and that
+      they should be protected against competing operations in other threads.
+      This would define a policy for adding appropriate locking.
+
+    - Move the creation of threads into source and loop-based elements. This will
+      make it possible for the elements in control of the threads to perform the
+      locking when needed. One particular instance is for example the state changes,
+      by creating the threads in the element, it is possible to sync the streaming
+      and the application thread (which does the state change).
+
+    - Remove negotiation from state changes. This will remove the conflict between
+      streaming and negotiating elements.
+
+    - add locks around pad operations like negotiation, streaming, linking, etc. This
+      will remove races between these conflicting operations. This will also make it
+      possible to un/block dataflow.
+
+    - add locks around bin operations like add/removing elements. 
+
+    - add locks around element operations like state changes and property changes.
+
+    - add a 2-phase directed negotiation process. The source pad queries and figures
+      out what the sinkpad can take in the first phase. In the second phase it sends
+      the new format change as an event to the peer element. This event can be 
+      interleaved with the buffers and can travel over queues inbetween the buffers.
+      Need to rethink this wrt bufferpools (see DShow and old bufferpool implementation)
+    
+    - add a preroll phase that will be used to spin up the pipeline and align frames/samples
+      in the sinks. This phase will happen in the PAUSED state. This also means that
+      dataflow will happen in the PAUSED state. Sinks will not sink samples in the PAUSED
+      state but will complete their state change asynchronously. This will allow 
+      us to have perfect synchronisation with the clock.
+
+    - a two phase seek policy. First the event travels upstream, putting all elements in
+      the seeking phase and making them synchronize to the new position. In the 
+      second phase the DISCONT event signals the end of the seek and all filters can
+      continue with the new position.
+
+    - Error messages, EOS, tags and other events in the pipeline should be sent to a 
+      mainloop. The app then has an in-thread mechanism for getting information about
+      the pipeline. It should also be possible to get the messages directly from the
+      elements itself, like signals. The application programmer has to know that 
+      working these events come from another thread and should handle them accordingly.
+
+    - Add return values to push/pull so that errors upstream or downstream can be noted
+      by other elements so that they can disable themselves or propagate the error.
+
+
+3) detailed explanation
+
+ a) Pipeline construction
+
+   Pipeline construction includes:
+
+     - adding/removing elements to the bin
+     - finding elements in a bin by name and interface
+     - setting the clock on a pipeline.
+     - setting properties on objects
+     - linking/unlinking pads
+
+     These operations should take the object lock to make sure it can be
+     executed from different threads.
+
+   When connecting pads to other pads from elements inside another bin, 
+   we require that the bin has a ghostpad for the pad. This is needed so
+   that the bin looks like a self-contained element.
+

+       +---------+     +-----------------------+
+
+   This requirement is important when we need to sort the elements in the
+   bin to perfrom the state change.
+     
+
+   testcases:
+
+    - create a bin, add/remove elements from it
+    - add/remove from different threads and check the bin integrity.
+
+  b) state changes
+
+     An element can be in one of the four states NULL, READY, PAUSED, PLAYING.
+
+      NULL: starting state of the element
+      READY: element is ready to start running.
+      PAUSED: element is streaming data, has opened devices etc.
+      PLAYING: element is streaming data and clock is running
+
+     Note that data starts streaming even in the PAUSED state. The only difference 
+     between the PAUSED and PLAYING state is that the clock is running in the 
+     PLAYING state. This mostly has an effect on the renderers which will block on 
+     the first sample they receive when in PAUSED mode. The transition from 
+     READY->PAUSED is called the preroll state. During that transition, media is
+     queued in the pipeline and autoplugging is done. 
+
+     Elements are put in a new state using the _set_state function. This function
+     can return the following return values:
+
+       typedef enum {
+         GST_STATE_FAILURE             = 0,
+         GST_STATE_PARTIAL             = 1,
+         GST_STATE_SUCCESS             = 2,
+         GST_STATE_ASYNC               = 3
+       } GstElementStateReturn;
+ 
+     GST_STATE_FAILURE is returned when the element failed to go to the 
+     required state. When dealing with a bin, this is returned when one
+     of the elements failed to go to the required state. The other elements 
+     in the bin might have changed their states succesfully. This return
+     value means that the element did _not_ change state, for bins this
+     means that not all children have changed their state.
+
+     GST_STATE_PARTIAL is returned when some elements in a bin where in the 
+     locked state and therefore did not change their state. Note that the 
+     state of the bin will be changed regardless of this PARTIAL return value.
+
+     GST_STATE_SUCCES is returned when all the elements successfully changed their
+     states.
+
+     GST_STATE_ASYNC is returned when an element is going to report the success
+     or failure of a state change later.
+
+     The state of a bin is not related to the state of its children but only to
+     the last state change directly performed on the bin or on a parent bin. This
+     means that changing the state of an element inside the bin does not affect
+     the state of the bin.
+
+     Setting the state on a bin that is already in the correct state will
+     perform the requested state change on the children.
+
+     Elements are not allowed to change their own state. For bins, it is allowed
+     to change the state of its children. This means that the application
+     can only know about the states of the elements it has explicitly set.
+
+     There is a difference in the way a pipeline and a bin handles the state
+     change of its children:
+
+      - a bin returns GST_STATE_ASYNC when one of its children returns an
+        ASYNC reply.
+
+      - a pipeline never returns GST_STATE_ASYNC but returns from the state
+        change function after all ASYNC elements completed the state change.
+        This is done by polling the ASYNC elements until they return their
+        final state.
+
+     The state change function must be fast an cannot block. If a blocking behaviour
+     is unavoidable, the state change function must perform an async state change.
+     Sink elements therefore always use async state changes since they need to
+     wait before the first buffer arrives at the sink.
+
+     A bin has to change the state of its children elements from the sink to the
+     source elements.  This makes sure that a sink element is always ready to 
+     receive data from a source element in the case of a READY->PAUSED state change.
+     In the case of a PAUSED->READY state, the sink element will be set to READY 
+     first so that the source element will receive an error when it tries to push 
+     data to this element so that it will shut down as well.
+
+     For loop based elements we have to be careful since they can pull a buffer 
+     from the peer element before it has been put in the right state. 
+     The state of a loop based element is therefore only changed after the source
+     element has been put in the new state.
+
+  c) Element state change functions
+
+     The core will call the change_state function of an element with the element
+     lock held. The element is responsible for starting any streaming tasks/threads
+     and making sure that it synchronizes them to the state change function if 
+     needed.
+
+     This means that no other thread is allowed to change the state of the element
+     at that time and for bins, it is not possible to add/remove elements.
+
+     When an element is busy doing the ASYNC state change, it is possible that another
+     state change happens. The elements should be prepared for this.
+     
+     An element can receive a state change for the same state it is in. This
+     is not a problem, some elements (like bins) use this to resynchronize their
+     children. Other elements should ignore this state change and return SUCCESS.
+     
+     When performing a state change on an element that returns ASYNC on one of
+     the state changes, ASYNC is returned and you can only proceed to the next
+     state change change when this ASYNC state change completed. Use the
+     gst_element_get_state function to know when the state change completed.
+     An example of this behaviour is setting a videosink to PLAYING, it will
+     return ASYNC in the state change from READY->PAUSED. You can only set
+     it to PLAYING when this state change completes.
+     
+     Bins will perform the state change code listed in d).
+     
+     For performing the state change, two variables are used: the current state
+     of the element and the pending state. When the element is not performing a
+     state change, the pending state == None. The state change variables are
+     protected by the element lock. The pending state != None as long as the
+     state change is performed or when an ASYNC state change is running.
+
+     The core provides the following function for applications and bins to
+     get the current state of an element:
+
+       bool gst_element_get_state(&state, &pending, timeout);
+
+     This function will block while the state change function is running inside
+     the element because it grabs the element lock. 
+     When the element did not perform an async state change, this function returns 
+     TRUE immediatly with the state updated to reflect the current state of the 
+     element and pending set to None. 
+     When the element performed an async state change, this function will block 
+     for the value of timeout and will return TRUE if the element completed the
+     async state change within that timeout, otherwise it returns FALSE, with
+     the current and pending state filled in.
+     
+     The algorithm is like this:
+
+       bool gst_element_get_state(elem, &state, &pending, timeout)
+       {
+         g_mutex_lock (ELEMENT_LOCK);
+         if (elem->pending != none) {
+	   if (!g_mutex_cond_wait(STATE, ELEMENT_LOCK, timeout) {
+	     /* timeout triggered */
+	     *state = elem->state;
+	     *pending = elem->pending;
+	     ret = FALSE;
+	   }
+         }
+         if (elem->pending == none) {
+           *state = elem->state;
+	   *pending = none;
+           ret = TRUE;
+         }
+         g_mutex_unlock (ELEMENT_LOCK);
+
+         return ret;
+       }
+     
+     For plugins the following function is provided to commit the pending state, 
+     the ELEMENT_LOCK should be held when calling this function:
+
+       gst_element_commit_state(element)
+       {
+         if (pending != none) {
+           state = pending;
+           pending = none;
+         }
+         g_cond_broadcast (STATE);
+       }
+
+     For bins the gst_element_get_state() works slightly different. It will run
+     the function on all of its children, as soon as one of the children returns
+     FALSE, the method returns FALSE with the state set to the current bin state
+     and the pending set to pending state. 
+
+     For bins with elements that did an ASYNC state change, the _commit_state() 
+     is only executed when actively calling _get_state(). The reason for this is 
+     that when a child of the bin commits its state, this is not automatically 
+     reported to the bin. This is not a problem since the _get_state() function 
+     is the only way to get the current and pending state of the bin and is always 
+     consistent.
+
+  d) bin state change algorithm
+
+     In order to perform the sink to source state change a bin must be able to sort 
+     the elements. To make this easier we require that elements are connected to
+     bins using ghostpads on the bin.
+
+     The algoritm goes like this:
+
+       d = [ ]                            # list of delayed elements
+       p = [ ]                            # list of pending async elements
+       q = [ elements without srcpads ]   # sinks
+       while q not empty do
+         e = dequeue q
+         s = [ all elements connected to e on the sinkpads ]
+         q = q append s
+         if e is entry point
+           d = d append e
+         else
+           r = state change e
+           if r is ASYNC
+             p = p append e
+       done
+       while d not empty do
+         e = dequeue d
+         r = state change e
+         if r is ASYNC
+           p = p append e
+       done
+       # a bin would return ASYNC here if p is not empty
+
+       # this last part is only performed by a pipeline
+       while p not empty do
+         e = peek p
+         if state completed e
+           dequeue e from p
+       done
+
+     The algorithm first tries to find the sink elements, ie. ones without
+     sinkpads. Then it changes the state of each sink elements and queues
+     the elements connected to the sinkpads.
+
+     The entry points (loopbased and getbased elements) are delayed as we 
+     first need to change the state of the other elements before we can activate 
+     the entry points in the pipeline.
+
+     The pipeline will poll the async children before returning.
+     
+  e) The GstTask infrastructure
+
+     A new component: GstTask is added to the core. A task is created by
+     an instance of the abstract GstScheduler class.
+
+     Each schedulable element (when added to a pipeline) is handed a
+     reference to a GstScheduler. It can use this object to create
+     a GstTask, which is basically a managed wrapper around a threading
+     library like GThread. It should be possible to write a GstScheduler
+     instance that uses other means of scheduling, like one that does not
+     use threads but implements task switching based on mutex locking.
+     
+     When source and loopbased elements want to create the streaming thread
+     they create an instance of a GstTask, which they pass a pointer to
+     a loop-function. This function will be called as soon as the element
+     performs GstTask.start(). The element can stop and uses mutexes to
+     pause the GstTask from, for example, the state change function or the
+     event functions.
+
+     The GstTasks implement the streaming threads.
+
+  f) the preroll phase
+
+     Element start the streaming threads in the READY->PAUSED state. Since
+     the elements that start the threads are put in the PAUSED state last,
+     after their connected elements, they will be able to deliver data to
+     their peers without problems.
+  
+     Sink elements like audio and videosinks will return an async state change
+     reply and will only commit the state change after receiving the first
+     buffer. This will implement the preroll phase.
+
+     The following pseudo code shows an algorithm for commiting the state
+     change in the streaming method.
+
+	  GST_OBJECT_LOCK (element);
+	  /* if we are going to PAUSED, we can commit the state change */
+	  if (GST_STATE_TRANSITION (element) == GST_STATE_READY_TO_PAUSED) {
+	    gst_element_commit_state (element);
+	  }
+	  /* if we are paused we need to wait for playing to continue */
+	  if (GST_STATE (element) == GST_STATE_PAUSED) {
+
+            /* here we wait for the next state change */
+	    do {
+	      g_cond_wait (element->state_cond, GST_OBJECT_GET_LOCK (element));
+	    } while (GST_STATE (element) == GST_STATE_PAUSED);
+
+            /* check if we got playing */
+            if (GST_STATE (element) != GST_STATE_PLAYING) {
+	      /* not playing, we can't accept the buffer */
+	      GST_OBJECT_UNLOCK (element);
+	      gst_buffer_unref (buf);
+	      return GST_FLOW_WRONG_STATE;
+	    }
+	  }
+	  GST_OBJECT_UNLOCK (element);
+
+     
+
+  g) return values for push/pull
+
+     To recover from pipeline errors in a more elegant manner than just 
+     shutting down the pipeline, we need more finegrained error messages
+     in the data transport. The plugins should be able to know what goes
+     wrong when interacting with their outside environment. This means
+     that gst_pad_push/gst_pad_pull and gst_event_send should return a
+     result code.
+
+     Possible return values include:
+
+      - GST_OK
+      - GST_ERROR
+      - GST_NOT_CONNECTED
+      - GST_NOT_NEGOTIATED
+      - GST_WRONG_STATE
+      - GST_UNEXPECTED
+      - GST_NOT_SUPPORTED
+
+      GST_OK
+        Data transport was successful
+
+      GST_ERROR
+        An error occured during transport, such as a fatal decoding error,
+        the pad should not be used again.
+
+      GST_NOT_CONNECTED
+        The pad was not connected
+
+      GST_NOT_NEGOTIATED
+        The peer does not know what datatype is going over the pipeline.
+
+      GST_WRONG_STATE
+        The peer pad is not in the correct state.
+
+      GST_UNEXPECTED
+        The peer pad did not expect the data because it was flushing or
+        received an eos.
+
+      GST_NOT_SUPPORTED
+        The operation is not supported.
+
+     The signatures of the functions will become:
+
+       GstFlowReturn gst_pad_push (GstPad *pad, GstBuffer *buffer);
+       GstFlowReturn gst_pad_pull (GstPad *pad, GstBuffer **buffer);
+
+       GstResult gst_pad_push_event (GstPad *pad, GstEvent *event);
+        
+	 - push_event will send the event to the connected pad.
+
+     For sending events from the application:
+
+       GstResult gst_pad_send_event (GstPad *pad, GstEvent *event);
+
+  h) Negotiation
+
+     Implement a simple two phase negotiation. First the source queries the
+     sink if it accepts a certain format, then it sends the new format
+     as an event. Sink pads can also trigger a state change by requesting
+     a renegotiation.
+
+  i) Mainloop integration/GstBus
+
+     All error, warning and EOS messages from the plugins are sent to an event
+     queue. The pipeline reads the messages from the queue and will either
+     handle them or forward them to the main event queue that is read by the
+     application.
+
+     Specific pipelines can be written that deal with negotiation messages and
+     errors in the pipeline intelligently. The basic pipeline will stop the
+     pipeline when an error occurs.
+
+     Whenever an element posts a message on the event queue, a signal is also
+     fired that can be catched by the application. When dealing with those
+     signals the application has to be aware that they come from the streaming
+     threads and need to make sure they use proper locking to protect their
+     own data structures.
+
+     The messages will be implemented using a GstBus object that allows
+     plugins to post messages and allows the application to read messages either
+     synchronous or asynchronous. It is also possible to integrate the bus in
+     the mainloop.
+
+     The messages will derive from GstData to make them a lightweight refcounted
+     object. Need to figure out how we can extend this method to encapsulate
+     generic signals in messages too.
+
+     This decouples the streaming thread from the application thread and should 
+     avoid race conditions and pipeline stalling due to application interaction.
+
+     It is still possible to receive the messages in the streaming thread context
+     if an application wants to. When doing this, special care has to be taken
+     when performing state changes.
+
+  j) EOS
+
+     When an element goes to EOS, it sends the EOS event to the peer plugin
+     and stops sending data on that pad. The peer element that received an EOS
+     event on a pad can refuse any buffers on that pad.
+
+     All elements without source pads must post the EOS message on the message
+     queue. When the pipeline receives an EOS event from all sinks, it will 
+     post the EOS message on the application message queue so that the application
+     knows the pipeline is in EOS. Elements without any connected sourcepads
+     should also post the EOS message. This makes sure that all "dead-ends" 
+     signalled the EOS.
+
+     No state change happens when elements go to EOS but the elements with the
+     GstTask will stop their tasks and so stop producing data.
+
+     An application can issue a seek operation which makes all tasks running 
+     again so that they can start streaming from the new location.
+     
+
+
+A) threads and lowlatency
+
+  People often think it is a sin to use threads in low latency applications. This is true
+  when using the data has to pass thread boundaries but false when it doesn't. Since
+  source and loop based elements create a thread, it is possible to construct a pipeline
+  where data passing has to cross thread boundaries, consider this case:
+
+     +-----------------------------------+
+     |      +--------+   +--------+      |
+     |      |element1|   |element2|      |
+     | .. -sink     src-sink     src- .. |
+     |      +--------+   +--------+      |
+     +-----------------------------------+
+
+   The two elements are loop base and thus create a thread to drive the pipeline. At the
+   border between the two elements there is a mutex to pass the data between the two 
+   threads. When using these kinds of element in a pipeline, low-latency will not be
+   possible. For low-latency apps, don't use these constructs!
+
+   Note that in a typical pipeline with one get-based element and two chain-based
+   elements (decoder/sink) there is only one thread, no data is crossing thread
+   boundaries and thus this pipeline can be low-latency. Also note that while this
+   pipeline is streaming no interaction or locking is done between it and the main
+   application.
+
+     +-------------------------------------+
+     | +--------+   +---------+   +------+ |
+     | | src    |   | decoder |   | sink | |
+     | |       src-sink      src-sink    | |
+     | +--------+   +---------+   +------+ |
+     +-------------------------------------+
+
+
+B) howto make non-threaded pipelines
+
+  For low latency it is required to not have datapassing cross any thread
+  borders. Here are some pointers for making sure this requirement is met:
+  
+  - never connect a loop or chain based element to a loop based element, this
+    will create a new thread for the sink loop element.
+
+  - do not use queues or any other decoupled element, as they implicitly 
+    create a thread boundary.
+
+  - At least one thread will be created for any source element (either in the
+    connected loop-based element or in the source itself) unless the source
+    elements are connected to the same loop based element. 
+
+  - when designing sinks, make them non-blocking, use the async clock callbacks
+    to schedule media rendering in the same thread (if any) as the clock. Sinks that
+    provide the clock can be made blocking.

+1) intro
+--------
+
+For efficient and accurate seeking, a plugin typically needs
+an index of possible seek positions (in time, bytes, samples, ...).
+
+The purpose of GstTimecache is to provide an infrastructure for
+plugins to maintain such an index.
+
+By creating a generic interace to this functionality, it is also
+possible for the application to make use of the generated index.
+possible use cases are: saving/loading of indexes, obtain an 
+overview of the indexed stream (where is sample N, where is
+the keyframe...)
+
+
+This document describes a proposed API for this functionality.
+
+
+2) Requirements
+---------------
+
+Bare minimum:
+
+- store mappings between format1 and format2 (bytes<->time, 
+  samples<->tracks, ...)
+- update the mappings (add/remove/change entries)
+- query the index, locate entries.
+- store arbitrary extra metadata in the timecache (media file,
+  time, author, ...)
+- set/get cache on elements.
+
+Nice to have:
+
+- cache groups with varying certainty that are merged.
+- API to control the indexing process, what gets indexed, how much,
+  ...)
+- Get notification when a new entry is added, together with an
+  option to turn off in-memory caching, this could be used to
+  do direct-to-disk indexing (for large files) insteda of to-memory.
+
+3) use cases
+------------
+
+a) indexing an mpeg systems stream
+
+  - create an empty timecache object
+  - create filesrc ! mpegparse
+  - set timecache on mpegparse
+  - run the pipeline to EOS
+    - mpegparse will create a mapping from SCR to byte offset
+      and add it to the cache.
+  - read/save timecache
+
+b) running an mpeg with a previously created cache
+
+  - create timecache object from saved index
+  - create filesrc ! mpegparse
+  - set the timecache on mpegparse
+  - run the pipeline, seek, ...
+    - mpegparse uses the timecache to do accurate seek to 
+      SCR timestamps.
+  
+c) indexing an mpeg systems stream, SCR, video and audio elementary
+   streams.
+
+  - create an empty timecache object
+  - create filesrc ! mpegdemux
+  - set timecache on mpegdemux
+  - run the pipeline to EOS
+    - mpegparse will create a mappings for: 
+       * SCR to byte offset
+       * PTS + streamid to byte offset
+      and add it to the cache.
+  - read/save timecache
+
+d) complete indexing of mpeg systems streams and audio/video
+   streams.
+
+  - create 3 empty timecaches
+  - create filesrc ! mpegdemux video_%02d! mpeg2dec 
+                     mpegdemux0 audio_%02d! mad
+  - set timecaches on mpegdemux, mpeg2dec, mad
+  - run pipeline to EOS
+    - mpegdemux creates timecache for SCR, PTS + streamid
+    - mpeg2dec creates timecache for frames + I/P/B id
+    - mad creates timecache for mpeg audio headers
+  - read/save timecaches
+  
+  seeking in a fully indexed stream:
+    - seek on timestamp in mpeg2dec
+    - mpeg2dec locates previous I frame in cache, does
+      a timeseek on sinkpad
+    - mpegparse uses the cache to convert the timestamp
+      to an offset, then does a seek on offset
+    - filesrc seeks to offset
+
+4) Entry types
+--------------
+
+ - mapping between formats:
+
+    <padid> <flags> <format> <position>, <format> <position>, ...
+
+ - metadata, streaminfo, other objects:
+
+    <padid> <format> <position>, <keyword> gpointer
+
+    
+5) implementation
+-----------------
+
+We define an abstract base class GstTimeCache with following
+abstract methods:
+
+
+6) cache format example
+-----------------------
+
+We define a binary format for the cache for space/speed reasons.
+It is entirely possible to create alternative implementations.

+Interface:
+- type (string like caps) channels/x-mpegts-pat
+- GstStructure to describe the what the list is, name, where from etc. (how many entries you can select, if multiple tried, first one picked)
+- method to list entries (channels)
+- method to get current entries
+- method to set list of entries
+- each entry contains an id (32 bit int say), GstStructure (with additional stuff)
+
+signals to say when entry list changes
+        to say when current entry changes
+
+So for a transport stream, this interface would be exported and it could contain a list of interfaces...eg it would export PAT, and PAT list would contain interfaces in the GstStructure for the PMT.
+
+dvbsrc -> list of frequencies
+flutsdemux -> list of programs (PAT) and list of PMT streams per program
+
+get list of frequencies, select frequency
+get list of programs, select programs
+get list of streams, select streams
+
+only give program details in PAT list, when we have seen the PMT for that program.
+
+possibly another interface to select multiple list interfaces from an element. (interface selector interface)
+

+ *
+ * Buffer lists are units of grouped scatter/gather data transfer in
+ * GStreamer.
+ *
+ * Buffer lists are created with gst_buffer_list_new() and filled with data
+ * using a #GstBufferListIterator. The iterator has no current buffer; its
+ * cursor position lies between buffers, immediately before the buffer that
+ * would be returned by gst_buffer_list_iterator_next(). After iterating to the
+ * end of a group the iterator must be advanced to the next group by a call to
+ * gst_buffer_list_iterator_next_group() before any further calls to
+ * gst_buffer_list_iterator_next() can return buffers again. The cursor position
+ * of a newly created iterator lies before the first group; a call to
+ * gst_buffer_list_iterator_next_group() is necessary before calls to
+ * gst_buffer_list_iterator_next() can return buffers.
+ *
+ * <informalexample>

+ *    Iterator positions
+ *   </programlisting>
+ * </informalexample>
+ *
+ * The gst_buffer_list_iterator_remove(), gst_buffer_list_iterator_steal(),
+ * gst_buffer_list_iterator_take(), gst_buffer_list_iterator_do() and
+ * gst_buffer_list_iterator_do_data() functions are not defined in terms of the
+ * cursor position; they operate on the last element returned from
+ * gst_buffer_list_iterator_next().
+ *
+ * The basic use pattern of creating a buffer list with an iterator is as
+ * follows:
+ *
+ * <example>
+ * <title>Creating a buffer list</title>
+ *   <programlisting>
+ *    GstBufferList *list;

+Q: How do I add source files to be translated ? 
+A: - Make sure the source file includes either gst-i18n-lib.h (if it's a part
+     of a library/plugin) or gst-i18n-app.h (if it's an application)
+   - Add the file path, relative to the top of the module, to POTFILES.in
+
+Q: How do I add/mark strings to be translated ?
+A: - Use N_(...) to mark for translation.
+   - Use _(...) to get a translated string
+   - run "make gstreamer-0.10.pot-update" to update the .pot file
+     and check if your new strings got added
+
+Q: How do I add a language ?
+A: - copy gstreamer-0.10.pot to your new language.po
+   - add the language code to LINGUAS
+   - edit the header of this language.po file and make it match one of
+     the existing .po files
+   - translate the strings
+
+Q: How do I update a language ?
+A: - run make language.po-update to update your .po file
+     (replace language with your language code)
+   - edit the .po file, and translate the untranslated strings
+   - run make install from the .po dir (so the updated strings get installed
+     and will be used in the lib/app) and test if the new strings are
+     translated
+     (To check, you need to export LANG=ll_LL.  Make sure you add the last
+      bit; ie. for Dutch you need export LANG=nl_NL)

+The following plugin modes are supported:
+
+1) registry based 
+-----------------
+
+All known plugins are listed in the registry file.
+
+  gst_plugin_find ("pluginname");
+
+Works right after gst_init (), along with the elements in it.
+dynamic loading of the plugin is performed when a feature inside 
+it is requested.
+
+example: registry.c. (You might want to run gstreamer-register with
+the --gst-plugin-path=. to added the test dir to the plugin path so
+that the testplugins can be found)
+
+
+2) non registry based, dynmic loading
+-------------------------------------
+
+Plugins are know after a gst_plugin_load ("pluginname"). This 
+function will scan de plugin paths, so you might want to perform
+a gst_plugin_add_path ("path").
+
+After the gst_plugin_load(), the features are available without any
+further actions.
+
+example: dynamic.c
+
+
+3) non registry based, shared linking
+-------------------------------------
+
+You can add the plugin .so (or equivalent) file to the LDFLAGS at 
+compile time. The plugin will be known after the gst_init() without
+any further actions.
+
+example: linked.c
+
+
+4) non registry based, static linking
+-------------------------------------
+
+Plugin compiled with the GST_PLUGIN_STATIC defined can be statically
+linked to the executable. The plugin is available after gst_init () 
+without any further actions.
+
+example: static.c (plugins are statically linked from another file)
+         static2.c (plugins are included in the main file)
+
+
+Any combination of the above is possible too, for example, you can use
+a registry, have some plugins load dynamically and have another few
+linked in as a shared lib. 
+
+You cannot statically link multiple plugins that are compiled without the
+GST_PLUGIN_STATIC symbol defined (this will cause multiple defined at link
+time for obvious reasons)
