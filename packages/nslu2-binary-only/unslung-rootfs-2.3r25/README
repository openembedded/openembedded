UNLUNG-4.x Family Release README INSTALLATION

You must follow the steps in this README *exactly*.  Do not skip any steps, and
do not skip ahead thinking you know what you are doing and don't need to follow
instructions step by step.

If at any time you have any questions concerning the installation or operation
of Unslung firmware, your first port of call should be the NSLU2-Linux wiki at:

     http://www.nslu2-linux.org

If you are looking for further Unslung notes - including ipkg usage, diversion
script details, or ChangeLog information, please consult the associated NOTES
file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three parts to completing the installation of the Unslung firmware:

     1 - PRE-INSTALLATION CONSIDERATIONS
     2 - FIRMWARE INSTALLATION DETAILS
     3 - UNSLINGING DETAILS


PRE-INSTALLATION CONSIDERATIONS

1) You *must* test telnet Redboot access first before you flash the Unslung
     firmware.  Failure to do so will mean you get no sympathy at all if you
     can't access Redboot when you need to recover from a bad flash.  See

     http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/TelnetIntoRedBoot

     - Redboot is the bootloader that runs when the device is first started,
          loading things into memory and starting Linux.  By testing your
          ability to telnet into Redboot, you are ensuring that if you injure
          your NSLU2 with a bad flash you should be able to follow the "How
	  To Recover From A Bad Flash" instructions at

          http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/RecoverFromABadFlash

2) If you want to install any packages, then you must have an external disk.
     It is possible to make changes to the root filesystem in the internal
     flash storage, but the space is very limited.  In fact, just running
     "ipkg update" on an NSLU2 which does not have an external disk attached
     is likely to render the NSLU2 unusable due to filling up the flash (if
     this happens then you will need to follow the recovery instructions in
     the previous step).  So unless you are an expert, then use an external
     disk.

3) The external disk that you use as the target for package installation must
     be (or have previously been) formatted by the NSLU2.  It is possible to
     upgrade from UNSLUNG 1.x, 2.x and 3.x without reformatting your disk.
     The unsling script will not touch anything in /unslung or /opt on your
     disk, so make sure all your file modifications are in those directories,
     as you were warned in the README file in UNSLUNG 1.x, 2.x and 3.x :-)

4) If you want to use a flash disk as the target for package installation,
     ensure that it is at least 256MB, plugged into port 1, and formatted
     via the Linksys web interface.

5) Please verify that any disks you are going to connect to the NSLU2 are
     recognized and working properly *before* updating your firmware (including
     any shares and data you had previously stored.)  If not, DO NOT CONTINUE.

     - The only exception to this, of course, are those enclosures that the
          stock firmware does not support, but the Unslung firmware does
          support.

6) If you are upgrading your firmware, you should make a configuration backup
     via the Linksys web interface.  The configuration backup can be found
     under "Administration", "Advanced", and then "Backup."  The top section of
     that webpage is titled "Config Backup" and "Download" should be used to
     save your NSLU2 Users, Groups and Shares setup to a disk file.


FIRMWARE INSTALLATION DETAILS

1) Shutdown the NSLU2, and remove any disks that you may have plugged into the
     NSLU2.  Power back up the NSLU2.

     - Firmware upgrades must always be performed with *no* hard disks or flash
          disks attached.  This CANNOT be emphasized enough.  Are you sure you
          unplugged the disks before powering up?  If so, you may continue.

2) Access the Web interface '''using admin as username, and admin as password.'''
   ''None of the users you have previously defined will run as I guess they are
   all stored in the passwd file that is on the disk you just disconnected.''

     2-a) If you are installing Unslung 4.x onto an NSLU2 unit with Linksys
          standard firmware *or* UNSLUNG 1.x or 2.x, flash unslung-4.x.bin as
          you normally would flash new firmware (using the web interface
          "Upgrade Firmware" page).

     2-b) If you are installing Unslung 4.x onto an NSLU2 unit with version 3.x
          or verions 4.x already installed, you must put the NSLU2 into
          maintenance mode before you can use the web interface to flash a new
          version.  Just click the "Enter Maintenance Mode" link on the web
          interface "Upgrade Firmware" page, wait for the NSLU2 to reboot, and
          then flash the new firmware in the normal manner (using the web
          interface "Upgrade Firmware" page).

     - During firmware flashing, the top LED - Ready/Status - flashes red and
          green (approximately 5 minutes), and you should receive a Javascript
          message that indicates that the flash of the firmware was successful.

          During flashing, some browsers may hog 100% CPU, and the flashing may
          take a long time, longer than 5 mins as reported by the web
          interface. You are advised not to have other activities going on at
          the client while flashing.

     - The NSLU2 will reboot after the flashing is complete.

3) Shutdown the NSLU2 (again), attach disk(s), and power it back up.

4) Verify your NSLU2 is working normally again at this point in the web
     interface.  In  particular, you should ensure that all your disks are still
     recognized as they were before you updated the firmware (including
     any shares and data you had previously stored.)  If not, DO NOT CONTINUE.

     - If you are not "unslinging", you can stop at this point.  The only
          reason for not unslinging would be in the case of a re-flash of the
          SAME firmware.  Even if this is a point firmware upgrade, you will
          need to unsling.

     ***** If you do not choose to do the unslinging procedure described below,
          DO NOT install packages unless you are SURE you know what you are
          doing!  "Bricking" your NSLU2 by not unslinging and then running ipkg
          is not just a possibility, it is a certainty.

5) Shutdown the NSLU2 and unplug *ALL* attached disks.

     - You must NOT have any disk plugged into the NSLU2 when you reboot to
          perform the next part of installation - the "Unslinging".


'UNSLINGING' DETAILS

"Unslinging" is the process of copying the root filesystem of your NSLU2 onto
an external disk, and configuring that external disk for installation of
packages. Basically it's a script (stored in /sbin/unsling) which copies all
the files from the internal jffs2 filesystem onto the external disk and tells
the internal firmware to load the root filesystem from the external disk when
booting in the future.

To run the unsling-script you have to be logged in as root (with a telnet
session).

NOTE: There are two root-passwords. One is saved in a internal file called
/usr/local/passwd (we know this one - it's "uNSLUng" and used when you boot
without a attached harddisk) the other is stored in a external file called
/share/hdd/conf/passwd (we don't know this one - it's used when you boot with a
external harddisk attached). Later in the process you can change both of
them. That means: Everytime you boot WITHOUT a attached harddisk you gain
root-access with the "uNSLUng" password. If you boot WITH an attached harddisk,
you won't have access until you change the file /share/hdd/conf/passwd.

1) Power up the NSLU2 without any disks connected.

     - This only has to be done when you update the firmware, and because
          UNSLUNG 3.x now runs completely from the internal flash memory, it is
          no longer necessary to "unsling" to an external disk unless you wish
          to store downloadable packages on that disk - which you will probably
          want to do, because the internal flash memory only has enough spare
          room for one or two very small packages.

     ***** To reiterate, you should not have a disk plugged in at this stage.
          If you powered up your NSLU2 with a disk attached, shutdown the
          NSLU2, unplug the disks, and power up again.

2) Enable telnet by going to "http://192.168.1.77/Management/telnet.cgi", and
     press the enable button.

     - If you had previously changed the IP address of your NSLU2 from
          192.168.1.77 to something else, then you should use that new IP
          address to enable telnet.  Also note that you should use the username
          "admin" and password "admin" for the web interface at this point (as
          no disks are attached, the default username and password is the only
          way to access the Management web pages).

     - Make sure you have **** NO DISKS ATTACHED AT THIS TIME ****

     - If you plug a disk in before you complete the telnet connection, then
          the NSLU2 will pick up the Linksys password from the disk, and you
          will not be able to telnet into it.  So don't have any disks attached
          at this point.

     - Make sure you have **** NO DISKS ATTACHED AT THIS TIME ****

3) OK, now that you don't have any disks attached, you can proceed and telnet
     into the NSLU2 using the username root and password uNSLUng.

4) Identify which drive you wish you "unsling", and plug it in.  Wait a minute
     or two while the disk is mounted.  Check the web interface to make sure
     that the disk has been recognised by the Linksys software.

     - If the disk has not been previously formatted on the NSLU2, then now is
          the time to do that.  Make sure that the drive is recognized in the
          web interface.

5) In the telnet session, run "/sbin/unsling disk1" or "/sbin/unsling disk2"
     (depending upon whether you want to unsling to a disk connected to the
     Disk1 port or the Disk2 port).

     - Once you "unsling" to an external disk on a particular port (Disk 1 or
          Disk 2), it is important that you keep that disk continually plugged
          into that same port whenever the NSLU2 is turned on.

     ***** Unsling will not change the password on your disk, so if you had
          previously changed the password on a disk, then your password will
          not be changed.  Also note that simply editing the /etc/passwd file
          is not enough to permanently change a password.  See

          http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/ChangePasswordsFromTheCommandLine

6) If you wish to migrate your packages from the old Unslung 3.x location in
     the /share/hdd/conf (disk1) or /share/flash/conf (disk2) partitions to the
     new Unslung 4.x location on the data partition, then run:
     "/sbin/slingover disk1" (if your packages were previously on disk1 and you
     ran "/sbin/unsling disk1" in step 5) or "/sbin/slingover disk2" (if your
     packages were previously on disk2 and you ran "/sbin/unsling disk2" in
     step 5).

     - If your packages were not stored in /share/hdd/conf or /share/flash/conf
	  (e.g. you had previously moved your packages from the conf partition
 	  to the data partition), then all bets are off and you will need to
          read the /sbin/slingover script and perform the appropriate steps
          manually.

7) Reboot.

***** Congratulations, you're now Unslung! *****

Make sure you add an entry to the "The UNSLUNG 4.x" table in the Yahoo group.
Just use the next free integer for your Unslung number.

If you make no further changes, your NSLU2 will continue to operate normally.
But to customize things, you'll be downloading packages and adding stuff to the
/unslung directory using diversion scripts.

Read the NOTES file to expand the capabilities of your uNSLUng NSLU2!

Enjoy!
