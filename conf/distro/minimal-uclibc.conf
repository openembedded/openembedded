#@DESCRIPTION: uClibc based Embedded Linux Distribution Configuration (minimal)
#
#@COMMENT: This distribution configuration serves as a starting point for
#@COMMENT: the integration of new target platforms, machines, or distributions.
#@COMMENT: It bases on conservative settings and should always be buildable.

require conf/distro/minimal.conf

# NOTE:
#
# We get the DISTRO_FEATURES defined in minimal.conf here but
# however there are some features like mips -mplt support which
# is not supported on uclibc yet so we need to disable that
# feature for uclibc based distributions, therefore we redefine
# the DISTRO_FEATURES for minimal-uclibc and notably leave mplt
# out. Make sure that if there is a new DISTRO_FEATURE thats added
# to minimal.conf will not get included in minimal-uclibc.conf
# it has to be added to the below selection if it should also be
# enabled for minimal-uclibc
