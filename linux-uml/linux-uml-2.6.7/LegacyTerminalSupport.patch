The second adds the LEGACY_PTY config option. Without it, with late 2.6 kernels 
/dev/ptyxx won't work. In fact, with those kernels, root_fs_toms does not 
work, because it's "unable to allocate TTY pair". And removes the dead option 
"UNIX98_PTY_COUNT" (just commented out for now).

+	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
+	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
+	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
+	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
+	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
+	  and xterms.

+	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
+	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
+	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
+	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
+	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
+	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
+	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
+	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.
+
+	  All modern Linux systems use the Unix98 ptys.  Say Y unless
